# EMERGENCY CAMPAIGN EXPORT - 2025-10-19

### Entry 0 - DM [2025-10-05T12:00:00.000Z]
The village of Thornhaven sits nestled in a valley beneath the towering peaks of the Silverpeak Mountains, their snow-capped summits glinting like dragon scales in the afternoon sun. The autumn air carries the scent of woodsmoke and freshly baked bread from the village bakery.

You stand in the common room of the Laughing Griffin tavern, where three adventurers have answered the urgent summons of Elder Miriam. The common folk whisper nervously at their tables - something has disturbed the ancient woods to the north.

**Kira Moonwhisper**, the moon elf scholar with silver hair and knowing violet eyes, studies a weathered map spread across the oak table.

**Thorne Ironheart**, the grizzled dwarven cleric whose warhammer has seen countless battles, stands with arms crossed, his expression grave.

**Riven Shadowstep**, the half-elf rogue whose reputation precedes them, idly spins a dagger while watching the tavern door.

Elder Miriam approaches your table, her face lined with worry. "Thank you for coming," she says quietly. "Three nights ago, the merchant caravan from Westmarch vanished in the Whispering Woods. We found one survivor - delirious, speaking of 'moving shadows' and 'eyes in the trees.' The town guard refuses to investigate. They say the woods have... changed."

She places a worn leather pouch on the table. The coins inside clink softly. "This is all we can offer - 500 gold pieces total. But if you don't help us, I fear Thornhaven will be cut off from the world. Please. Will you investigate the Whispering Woods and discover what happened to our people?"

The tavern falls silent, waiting for your answer.

What do you do?

### Entry 1 - PLAYER [2025-10-05T07:14:17.907Z]
kira asks if the survivor is available to talk to, to get more info

### Entry 2 - ASSISTANT [2025-10-05T07:14:17.907Z]
Elder Miriam nods at Kira's inquiry, her expression grave but understanding. "Aye, the survivor is here," she says, gesturing to a corner table where a young man sits, his eyes haunted by recent horrors. His clothes are tattered, and a bandage wraps around his forearm stained with dried blood.

Miriam adds softly, "His name is Ewan. He was the only one to escape the attack, but the experience has left him shaken. Be gentle with your questions, if you can."

As you approach Ewan, he looks up, his eyes flickering with a mix of fear and relief at the sight of new faces. He shifts uneasily, his hand gripping a mug of steaming tea as if it were a lifeline.

What do you do?

Roll Persuasion (DC 14) to gently encourage Ewan to reveal more about his experience. DM (GPT-4): 19 (rolled 19)

### Entry 4 - ASSISTANT [2025-10-05T07:16:27.711Z]
Kira approaches Ewan with a gentle demeanor, her eyes reflecting empathy and understanding. "Ewan," she begins softly, "we're here to help. Anything you can tell us about what happened could make a difference. Take your time, and know that you're safe with us."

Ewan takes a deep breath, visibly relaxing as Kira's words reach him. His fingers tremble slightly as he grips the edge of the table, but he manages a nod. "It was... it was unlike anything I've seen," he begins, voice shaky but gaining strength. "We were out in the woods, just a few of us hunting for the village. At first, it was just shadows moving too fast to be natural. Then the air grew cold, and we heard this... this sound, like whispers in a language I couldn't understand."

He pauses, eyes distant as if replaying the scene in his mind. "There were shapes, figures made of darkness itself. They came at us, and we tried to fight, but our weapons passed through them like smoke. I ran... it's all I could do."

Ewan shudders, and Kira can sense the weight of survivor's guilt in his words. "I don't know if it was magic or something else, but whatever it was, it's not natural. It didn't belong in our world."

He looks up at Kira, eyes pleading. "Please, if you can stop it... if you can save the others, I'll do anything to help."

Ewan's account provides the party with a clearer picture of the threat - a supernatural force shrouded in mystery, preying upon the village. The stakes have risen, and the party's path is set toward uncovering and confronting this dark menace.

### Entry 5 - PLAYER [2025-10-05T07:17:48.382Z]
kira convenes with thorne and riven to ask if they know what this mysterious force may be based on the information given so far. they want to know what they're facing before they make any hasty agreements.

### Entry 6 - ASSISTANT [2025-10-05T07:17:48.382Z]
As the three adventurers huddle together at a corner table of the Laughing Griffin tavern, the flickering hearth casts long shadows on the wooden walls. The murmurs of the villagers fade into the background, giving the group a moment of relative privacy.

Kira recounts the details they've gathered from Ewan and Elder Miriam. "Ewan mentioned shadows moving on their own and an unnatural chill that felt like it seeped into your bones. Whatever attacked them left no tracks, but it struck with terrifying precision."

Thorne furrows his brow, his fingers absentmindedly tracing the edge of his shield. "Sounds like dark magic to me. Could be a specter or some malevolent spirit. I've dealt with such before, but never without a proper clerical ritual."

Riven, leaning back in their chair, adds with a thoughtful nod, "Could also be someone using illusion magic to disguise their presence. I've seen rogue mages use tricks like that to great effect. The lack of tracks might be a misdirection."

The trio falls into silence, each considering the implications of what they've heard. The potential danger is clear, but without more concrete information, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what they're facing. As they deliberate, a sense of urgency hangs in the air, a reminder that the safety of Thornhaven might depend on their next move.

### Entry 7 - PLAYER [2025-10-05T07:18:58.565Z]
kira probes thorne on what he may be able to do as a cleric out here without a proper ritual. what may he have on him that could help; what spells; and such.

### Entry 8 - ASSISTANT [2025-10-05T07:18:58.565Z]
The dim light of the Laughing Griffin tavern dances across Thorne's face as he considers Kira's question. He strokes his braided beard thoughtfully, the rings within it clinking softly. "Aye, lass," he begins, his voice a deep rumble like distant thunder. "Even without a temple, the blessings of my deity travel with me."

He reaches for his worn leather satchel, undoing the clasp to reveal a small assortment of items and trinkets. Among them lies a polished holy symbol, its surface etched with the sigil of his deity, a sturdy tome of prayer, and several vials of sacred water.

"As for spells," Thorne continues, "I can call upon healing magics to mend wounds or bolster our spirits. I can ward against evil, should we encounter it, and dispel dark magics. And in dire moments, I can channel divine energy to turn the undead, should they rise against us."

He closes the satchel with a decisive nod. "Though we lack a formal altar, the strength of faith is enough to bring aid to those in need. What we face may be unknown, but the light of my deity will guide us."

Thorne's confidence is palpable, offering reassurance in the face of uncertainty. His presence is a reminder that even in the darkest times, hope can shine through.

### Entry 9 - PLAYER [2025-10-05T10:53:07.838Z]
can you add some items to thorne's inventory from what he has in his satchel? a modest amount, 3 inv items at most. also some 5e spells that make sense for someone of his class and level.

### Entry 10 - ASSISTANT [2025-10-05T10:53:07.838Z]
Certainly! Let's add a few items and spells to Thorne Ironheart's inventory and spell list.

### Inventory Additions:
1. **Healing Potion**: A small vial filled with a shimmering, red liquid. When consumed, it restores a bit of vitality to the drinker.
2. **Holy Symbol of Moradin**: A finely crafted silver amulet depicting an anvil and hammer, which Thorne uses as a focus for his divine magic.
3. **Rations (1 day's worth)**: A neatly wrapped package containing dried meats, nuts, and a small loaf of hard bread - sustenance for a journey.

### Spells for Thorne (5e Cleric Spells):
1. **Cure Wounds**: A spell that allows Thorne to channel divine energy to mend injuries, healing the target's wounds upon touch.
2. **Bless**: A protective enchantment that enhances the abilities of Thorne and his allies, granting them divine favor in battle.
3. **Guiding Bolt**: A radiant bolt of light that Thorne can hurl at an enemy, illuminating them and providing an advantage to the next attack against them.

These additions should serve Thorne well in his role as a steadfast protector and healer within the party. If you have any specific requests or need further details, feel free to ask!

### Entry 11 - PLAYER [2025-10-07T12:19:38.401Z]
kira nods to thorne and asks riven's opinion on heading out to defeat this evil.

### Entry 12 - ASSISTANT [2025-10-07T12:19:38.401Z]
Riven leans back in their chair, fingers drumming a thoughtful rhythm on the worn wooden table. Their heterochromatic eyes—one green, one amber—study both Kira and Thorne before shifting to the nervous villagers and the haunted figure of Ewan across the room.

"Defeat evil?" they murmur, a wry smile playing at the corners of their mouth. "Such noble words, Kira. Though I suppose that's what we do now, isn't it?" 

They lean forward, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Here's what I think—whatever's out there in those ruins, it's not going to get weaker with time. Shadows that move on their own, unnatural cold, no tracks..." Riven's fingers trace an absent pattern on the table, as if mapping out possibilities. "Could be undead. Could be something worse. Either way, it's already claimed lives."

Their expression grows more serious, the playful edge fading. "I've learned that hesitation often costs more than action. If we're going to do this, we should move while we still have daylight to reach the ruins. Scout the area before nightfall, understand the terrain, maybe find where Ewan's companions fell."

Riven glances at Thorne's holy symbol, then at Kira's scholarly satchel. "Between divine blessings, arcane knowledge, and my particular skillset, we might actually stand a chance. But we need a plan—not just charging in like heroes from a bard's tale."

They pause, meeting each of their companions' eyes in turn. "So yes, I say we go. But smart. Careful. What do you both think—reconnaissance first, or do we have enough information to act?"

**DM (CLAUDE)**

### Entry 13 - PLAYER [2025-10-08T15:07:21.774Z]
we go in careful. take some time to scout. if we plan it right, we won't need to fight long - strike from the shadows, have thorne ready to cleanse whatever needs cleansing.
i suppose we should go and agree to the deal. 500 gold was it?

### Entry 14 - ASSISTANT [2025-10-08T15:07:21.774Z]
Riven's eyes gleam with approval at the cautious approach. "Now that's thinking like a professional," they say, a hint of their old guild training showing through. "Scout, strike, survive. The three S's that kept me breathing all these years."

Thorne nods gravely, one hand resting on his holy symbol. "Aye, and I'll be ready with Moradin's blessing to purify whatever corruption we find. Dark magic leaves wounds on the world itself—wounds that need divine healing."

The three of you rise from the corner table and make your way through the nervous crowd to where Elder Miriam stands near the hearth. She looks up as you approach, hope flickering in her weathered eyes.

"Elder Miriam," Kira begins, "we've discussed your offer, and we're prepared to investigate the Whispering Hollows. The terms were 500 gold pieces—250 now, and 250 upon our return with proof of what happened and assurance the threat is ended?"

The elder's shoulders sag with visible relief. "Aye, that's the agreement. Though I'll be honest with you—" she lowers her voice, glancing around to ensure the other villagers aren't listening too closely, "—if you can truly end this threat, Thornhaven will find ways to show additional gratitude. Safe roads mean trade can resume. Crops can be harvested without fear. That's worth more than gold to these folk."

She produces a worn leather pouch from beneath her shawl, its weight suggesting considerable coin within. "Here's the 250 gold advance. May the old gods watch over you in those woods." Her hand trembles slightly as she passes it to Kira.

Ewan, still seated at his corner table, calls out weakly, "The shadows... they moved *wrong*. Like they were alive. Don't let them surround you."

Elder Miriam adds, "You'll want to set out soon—there's perhaps three hours of good daylight left. The Hollows are about an hour's walk northeast, following the old logging road. Most folk won't go within a hundred paces of the tree line anymore."

She pauses, then adds quietly, "And if you find... if you find what's left of the missing villagers, please try to bring something back. Their families deserve to lay them to rest properly."

**What do you do?**

**DM (CLAUDE)**

### Entry 15 - PLAYER [2025-10-08T15:09:58.405Z]
kira nods and leads the group out towards the enemy.

### Entry 16 - ASSISTANT [2025-10-08T15:09:58.405Z]
The afternoon sun hangs low over Thornhaven as the three adventurers make their way toward Elder Miriam's table. The elderly woman looks up from her worried conversation with a village guard, relief washing over her weathered features as she sees you approaching.

"You've decided then?" she asks, her voice carrying both hope and apprehension. "Five hundred gold pieces, aye—that's what the village council has scraped together. It's nearly everything we have, but lives are worth more than coin."

She gestures to a rough map spread across the table, drawn on scraped hide with charcoal. "The old mining camp lies about three miles northeast, up into the foothills. The path is well-worn but overgrown—hasn't been used regularly since the mine played out twenty years back. The attack happened at the old foreman's lodge."

Her finger traces the route. "You'll cross Silverstream Creek about a mile out, then follow the old cart track as it winds up through pine forest. The trees grow thick there—good for cover if you're moving careful-like. The lodge sits in a clearing where the miners used to gather. Stone foundation, wooden walls, though who knows what state it's in now."

She looks each of you in the eye. "The survivor, Ewan, says the attack came at dusk. Whatever it was moved through shadows like smoke, and the cold..." She shivers despite the tavern's warmth. "He said it felt like winter's heart had come to claim them."

Thorne adjusts his warhammer on his belt, the holy symbol of Moradin gleaming at his chest. Riven's hand instinctively checks their daggers, fingers dancing across hilts with practiced ease.

The path northeast awaits. The sun tells you that you have perhaps three hours before dusk begins to paint the mountains in shadow.

Do you set out immediately, or is there anything else you wish to do in the village before departing?
