### Entry 0 - UNKNOWN [2025-10-05T12:00:00.000Z]
The village of Thornhaven sits nestled in a valley beneath the towering peaks of the Silverpeak Mountains, their snow-capped summits glinting like dragon scales in the afternoon sun. The autumn air carries the scent of woodsmoke and freshly baked bread from the village bakery.

You stand in the common room of the Laughing Griffin tavern, where three adventurers have answered the urgent summons of Elder Miriam. The common folk whisper nervously at their tables - something has disturbed the ancient woods to the north.

**Kira Moonwhisper**, the moon elf scholar with silver hair and knowing violet eyes, studies a weathered map spread across the oak table.

**Thorne Ironheart**, the grizzled dwarven cleric whose warhammer has seen countless battles, stands with arms crossed, his expression grave.

**Riven Shadowstep**, the half-elf rogue whose reputation precedes them, idly spins a dagger while watching the tavern door.

Elder Miriam approaches your table, her face lined with worry. "Thank you for coming," she says quietly. "Three nights ago, the merchant caravan from Westmarch vanished in the Whispering Woods. We found one survivor - delirious, speaking of 'moving shadows' and 'eyes in the trees.' The town guard refuses to investigate. They say the woods have... changed."

She places a worn leather pouch on the table. The coins inside clink softly. "This is all we can offer - 500 gold pieces total. But if you don't help us, I fear Thornhaven will be cut off from the world. Please. Will you investigate the Whispering Woods and discover what happened to our people?"

The tavern falls silent, waiting for your answer.

What do you do?
