# Pop Culture References in Campaign

## Confirmed Pop Culture Borrowings

### Corporate/Faction Names
- **Weyland Biosystems**
  - Source: Alien franchise (Weyland-Yutani Corporation)
  - References: 770 across campaign files
  - Status: Established in campaign, keeping as-is
  - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Claude keeps hallucinating "Weyland-Yutani" instead of "Weyland Biosystems" despite 200+ context events
  - **Latest instance**: 2025-09-23 12:35 PM - "Model: Weyland-Yutani WY-Scout Class III" (fixed to "Weyland Biosystems WB-Scout Class III")
  - **Root cause**: Training data bias is stronger than campaign context

### Locations
- **Titan Station**
  - Source: Dead Space (major setting in Dead Space 2)
  - References: 576 across campaign files
  - Status: Established in campaign, keeping as-is

## Potentially Borrowed (To Investigate)

### Military/Security
- **Osprey** (security company)
  - Could be: Generic military contractor name OR borrowed from various franchises
  - Need to check: If this appears in specific sci-fi properties

### Government
- **U.E.S.** (United Earth Systems/Service)
  - Could be: Common sci-fi government abbreviation OR specific franchise reference
  - Status: Probably generic enough

## Original Campaign Elements (Confirmed Safe)
- **Meridian** (ship name offered by Director)
- **Dax Stargazer** (character name)
- **Chen** (character name)
- **Dr. Yuen** (character name)
- **Director Sarah Holbrook** (NPC)
- **Commander Torres** (NPC)
- **Jonathan Park** (NPC)
- **Captain Morrison** (deceased NPC)
- **Kellerman** (corporate representative)
- **Vexian** (alien species - Dax's race)

## Notes
- Pop culture references likely emerged from AI training data during world-building
- Most core story elements and character development remain original
- Campaign continuity more important than purging references at this point
- Document new suspicious names as they appear

## Close Call
- Nearly suggested "Meridian Life Sciences" as Weyland replacement, not realizing Meridian is already a ship name in our campaign!
- Shows importance of checking against existing campaign elements before suggesting replacements
