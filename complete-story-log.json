But that means going back through the Hub to reach it. The scanner is currently dead in your inventory, but it could be recharged if you return to that console.\r\nThat's actually a great tactical consideration. The scanner could:\r\n\r\nDetect life signs (find survivors or threats)\r\nAnalyze that heat signature below before you descend\r\nGet more data on the alien biology if you encounter another creature\r\n\r\nDo you want to:\r\n\r\nHead back to Central Hub first to recharge the scanner\r\nGo straight down to the storage bay without it\r\nTake a different path entirely\r\n\r\nWhat's Dax thinking?",

You'll need to:\r\n\r\nRemove the shattered old injector\r\nInstall the new one\r\nManually restart the coolant loop\r\nBring the reactor online in staged increments to avoid power surges\r\n\r\nChen watches your back, eyes scanning the webbed vents above. \"How long will this take?\"\r\nYou assess the setup. \"Ten minutes if nothing goes wrong. Maybe fifteen for a truly silent startup sequence.\"\r\nThe broken injector is a mess - crystallized plasma residue everywhere. You'll need to clean the housing before installing the new one. Your multi-tool should handle it, but working in near-darkness by console light will require precision.\r\nRoll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to perform the delicate installation and calibration without triggering any alarms or power surges that might attract attention.\r\nChen whispers, \"The vents have gone quiet.

The housing is scored and carbonized, but your multi-tool's plasma torch - set to its lowest, quietest setting - cleans it perfectly.\r\nChen watches in amazement as you install the new Plasma Injector with movements so smooth it barely makes a whisper.

The main cargo hold doors are sealed, but you can see through the reinforced windows - the entire bay is coated in the same organic film, with strange, pod-like growths on the walls.

The character appears to be mentioned in the system prompt as a \"United Earth Systems Representative - Nervous, on Titan Station\" and \"Government liaison for quarantine situation,\" but I don't have the detailed backstory or recent interactions with this character.\n\nCould you provide some context about Jonathan Park's role in the story? For example:\n- Have you interacted with them before?\n- Are they part of the upcoming legal meeting?\n- What's their connection to the Wanderer incident or current corporate conflict?\n- Are they an ally, neutral party, or potential threat?\n\nI want to give you accurate information about this NPC rather than improvising details that might contradict established story elements.]\n\n⏸️ Scene remains as described above\n\n**DM (CLAUDE)**",
