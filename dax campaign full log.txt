Of course. My apologies, the ship's manifest must have been corrupted when the power failed. I've managed to pull Dax Stargazer's file from a fragmented data-core. His vitals and stats appear stable.

Welcome aboard, Dax.

I've updated your adventure log with your character profile, including a newly rendered profile picture and your official stats. The ship's klaxon is still blaring... the situation seems to be getting worse, not better.

Here is your updated log.



The control is in your hands, Dax. The sidearm and datapad are within reach, the terminal is flickering, and the door leads out into the unknown.







i holster the sidearm, cautions not to mis-fire it as i do. i don't even know if the safety's on, i never had to use one of these things.

i check the datapad to see if it has any details of what's gone on.

With practiced dexterity, you use one of your upper hands to scoop up the sidearm. It feels heavy, unfamiliar. You find a magnetic holster plate on your hip and attach the weapon with a grim thunk. Your other hands are already reaching for the datapad.

The device is cool to the touch. Its screen is heavily spiderwebbed with cracks, but as your fingers brush against it, it sputters to life.

(You are a Tech-Scout with a high Intelligence. You should be able to bypass some of this damage. This will require an Intelligence check.)

You deftly manipulate the flickering interface, your Vexian fingers flying across the damaged screen. Corrupted data streams past, but you manage to isolate a few coherent, chilling fragments from the most recent log entries:

LOG #2241: ...unidentified biological signature detected in cargo bay...

LOG #2242: ...breach confirmed. Life support failing in Gamma-7. Quarantine protocols engaged...

LOG #2243: It's loose. God help us. Hostile, incredibly fast...

LOG #2244: ...only survivor on the bridge. Initiating emergency cryo-cycle for all crew. It's the only...

The log cuts off there. You also manage to access the ship's identification file: U.E.S. Wanderer - Long-Range Exploration Vessel. Your own crew manifest entry simply reads: Dax Stargazer, Technical Specialist. The words mean nothing to your fragmented memory.

The datapad's battery indicator flashes red and dies, leaving you once again in the pulsing crimson light of the med bay. You now know two things for certain: The ship is the Wanderer, and you are not alone.

The klaxon continues its maddening pulse. The damaged terminal to your right sparks intermittently. The door to the corridor remains slightly ajar, beckoning you into the dark unknown.

What do you do?









i try to access the terminal



(i've got the adventure log open on the side - can we get like still images in there occasionally? get a little dax profile box with an ID-style headshot of him?

also clickable dice appearing there when rolls are needed would be great)

Of course! I can definitely make the Adventure Log more interactive and visual. I've updated it with your requests. You'll find a new profile section for Dax, and I'll be adding images to mark key scenes, starting with this one. I've also added a new section for dice rolls.

You approach the sparking terminal. The screen is a mess of static and error codes, but you see a faint command prompt blinking behind the chaos. This is Vexian standard-issue tech; you feel a flicker of familiarity. You might be able to get it to respond, but one wrong move could fry the system for good.

This will require an Intelligence (Technology) check.

I've updated your Adventure Log. Take a look, and then tell me to "roll" the dice whenever you're ready.

Think of it as a ship-wide system glitch I'm working on! For now, I'll handle the rolls for you and describe the scenes and images as vividly as possible, like I did with the terminal. Let's get back to it!)

Your fingers dance across the console. A shower of sparks erupts from a damaged conduit, but you don't even flinch. With a few deft commands, you bypass the corrupted security layers and brute-force your way into the ship's local network.

The screen flickers from angry red static to a calm, functional blue. Three icons appear:

ALERT_SYSTEMS

SHIP_SCHEMATICS

SECURITY_CAMS

With a tap, you silence the klaxon. The sudden, profound silence is almost more unnerving than the alarm. The only sounds now are the low hum of emergency power and a faint, rhythmic thump... thump... thump... coming from somewhere down the corridor.

You open the schematics. A map of the U.E.S. Wanderer illuminates the screen. It's a mid-sized exploration vessel. You see your location marked in the Med Bay. Other key areas are labeled: Bridge, Engineering, Crew Quarters. One location, the Cargo Bay, is flashing with a persistent red warning icon labeled BIOHAZARD.

Finally, you try the security cameras. Most are offline, displaying static. However, one feed is still active, labeled CORRIDOR GAMMA-7 (the same sector mentioned in the datapad). The image is grainy and distorted, but it shows a long, metallic hallway... and something is wrong. The walls are covered in a dark, glistening, web-like substance that seems to pulse faintly.

The terminal has given you a lifeline. You know where you are, you know where the danger is, and you have a map to navigate the dead ship.

I've updated the log with the new scene.









I check the terminal technically and physically for some sort of engineer access, that might allow me to control doors, wary that the room i am in is partially open to the corridor.

Excellent thinking, Dax. Securing your position is a wise move before venturing into the unknown.

Your focus shifts from the ship-wide network to the terminal's immediate capabilities. Your upper hands deftly navigate the schematics, while your lower hands trace the physical conduits snaking from the terminal's base into the wall, trying to find the local control junction. You're looking for a subroutine that controls Med Bay's environmental systems—specifically, the door.

This requires a careful search of both the terminal's damaged software and its physical housing. It will be an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

I've updated the log. The control is yours.

You're so close you can taste it. Your upper hands isolate a system command labeled ENV_CTRL, but as you try to access it, a cascade of error messages floods the screen. [ACCESS DENIED: CORRUPTION DETECTED IN SECTOR M-BAY]. It's a dead end on the software side.

Simultaneously, your lower hands trace a thick bundle of wires to a junction box near the floor. You pry the cover off. Inside is a charred mess of melted plastic and fused wiring. The physical override for the door mechanism has been completely destroyed.

You cannot lock or unlock the Med Bay door from this terminal. The knowledge is unsettling. You are in a room you cannot secure, and that rhythmic thump... thump... thump... from the corridor outside seems to be getting slightly louder.

Your options have narrowed. The terminal has given you all it can for now. The door remains your only exit.

The log has been updated to reflect your attempt.









I look around the med bay for some way to check my own health status

A logical priority. Before facing the unknown, you must know your own condition.

You turn away from the unsettling door and scan the Med Bay. Most of the equipment is dark and lifeless. One of the diagnostic beds is shattered, glass and wiring strewn across the floor. However, your eyes catch a faint, intermittent green light blinking on a wall-mounted bio-monitor, the one directly connected to the cryo-pod you woke up in. Next to it, in a charging cradle, sits a handheld medical scanner. It might still have some power.

Your eyes, accustomed to scanning for technical details, now search for any flicker of life in the medical equipment. This will require a Wisdom (Perception) check to see if you can spot a functional device amidst the wreckage.

The log is updated. The rhythmic thumping from the hall continues its steady, patient beat.

Your sharp eyes easily pick out the handheld medical scanner. You pluck it from its cradle; it hums to life in your grasp, its battery surprisingly full. You press the cool metal of the device against your own forearm. A soft blue light emanates from it, scanning your physiology. A moment later, the results appear on its small screen.

Your physical condition is perfect—no injuries, no signs of cryo-sickness. You are at full strength. However, the scanner flags a minor, unidentified biological anomaly. When you run a focused scan on your head, it isolates a small, faint energy signature just behind your left temple. The scanner has no matching data in its logs. It's a complete unknown.

You now have a clean bill of health, but a new, small mystery to go with it. The scanner is a versatile tool, capable of detecting life signs and energy signatures.

The rhythmic thump... thump... from the corridor outside seems to have stopped. The silence that follows is somehow worse.

The log is updated. What is your next move, Dax?









If i have room on me, i pocket the scanner as well and take one last look at the terminal for the route from here to engineering













Show thinking



You deftly use one of your lower hands to slide the medical scanner into a utility pouch on your belt. It fits snugly. With your upper hands, you turn back to the terminal, its calming blue light a stark contrast to the emergency red that greeted you.

Accessing the SHIP_SCHEMATICS icon again is simple. You call up the map of the Wanderer and plot a course from your current location to Engineering. The terminal highlights the most direct route in a pulsating green line.

The path is clear, but not comforting:

Exit Med Bay into Corridor Gamma-7. This is the exact corridor you saw on the security camera feed—the one covered in the strange, glistening, web-like substance.

Proceed down Gamma-7 to the Central Hub.

From the Hub, take the aft corridor to the Engineering access lift.

The schematic also shows that the Cargo Bay, with its flashing BIOHAZARD warning, is directly adjacent to Corridor Gamma-7. Whatever is on this ship, its point of origin is very close to your intended path.

You have the map memorized. You have your sidearm. You have the scanner. The corridor outside is utterly silent. It's time to move.

I've updated the log with your new objective.









I open the door as quietly as possible and attempt to sneak down the corridor, being careful not to make noise and also not to touch the weird substance on the walls. i look to pause about half way to the central hub.















Show thinking



A wise, cautious approach. You need to know what you're walking into.

With your sidearm held low and ready in one hand, you use another to grip the edge of the Med Bay door. The hydraulic mechanism is damaged, and the metal groans in protest as you apply pressure. You freeze, listening, then continue, easing the door open just enough to slip your slender frame through.

You are in Corridor Gamma-7. It is even more unsettling in person. The substance is everywhere, thick, ropey strands of a dark, semi-translucent material that glistens wetly in the pulsing red light. It covers the walls, parts of the ceiling, and even pools on the floor in places. A faint, sweet, and faintly metallic smell hangs in the air. The silence is absolute.

Now comes the hard part. Moving down this compromised hallway without making a sound or, more importantly, touching that substance, will be a true test of your agility.

This will require a Dexterity (Stealth) check.

I have updated the log. Tell me when you are ready to roll.

You move with the innate grace of your people, your four limbs providing a stable base as you navigate the treacherous corridor. You successfully avoid the larger patches of webbing, your movements fluid and controlled. But the silence of the ship is a double-edged sword.

About ten meters down the hall, your foot comes down on a section of floor plating coated in a thin, almost invisible layer of the slick residue. It doesn't make a loud noise, but a soft, wet squelch echoes in the confined space.

Instantly, you freeze.

From the far end of the hall, near the large circular door leading to the Central Hub, you hear a reply. A wet, chitinous click-clack. Then a low, guttural hiss that seems to vibrate in your very bones.

Something is there. And it heard you.

You have a split second to react before it comes into view. A few meters ahead of you is a small maintenance alcove that offers some cover. The Med Bay is behind you.

The log has been updated. The hunt has begun.









I leap and tumble into the alcove as smooth and sullenly as i can

The moment the alien hiss cuts through the silence, your instincts take over. There's no time for a conscious thought, only pure, adrenal-fueled reaction.

You pivot on your heel, your four limbs coiling like springs. In a single, fluid motion, you launch yourself sideways. You tuck into a tight roll, your body a blur of motion against the grotesque backdrop of the webbed corridor. The maneuver is designed to be both swift and silent, using the momentum of your leap to carry you into the shadows of the maintenance alcove.

The alcove is a cramped space, a recess in the wall filled with thick power conduits and humming machinery. It offers solid cover, but the landing is critical. A clean entry means you might just vanish from the creature's senses. A clumsy one will be a dinner bell.

Your survival hinges on this acrobatic display. This will require a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

It's more than a tumble; it's a work of art.

You pour yourself into the alcove, a silent, liquid motion that barely disturbs the air. Your feet touch down without a sound, and you press your slender frame back into the shadows, making yourself one with the machinery. Not even the whisper of fabric against metal betrays your position.

A moment later, the creature scuttles past your hiding spot.

It's a nightmare of chitin and blades. Roughly the size of a large dog, it moves on four serrated, insectoid legs. Its carapace is a glistening, oily black, and two longer, scythe-like limbs are held ready at its front. It has no visible eyes, but its head, a wedge of sharp angles, tilts back and forth, "tasting" the air with a pair of twitching antennae. This is the Gloom Skitterer, and you are perfectly hidden from it.

The creature pauses exactly where you slipped, its head turning in slow circles. It is hunting, and it knows something is here. It just doesn't know where.

You have the element of complete surprise. From your shadowed position, you could act with impunity.

The log has been updated. You are the unseen predator now.









Does the med scanner make noise?













Show thinking



That's a critical question, Dax. Your life might depend on the answer.

You examine the scanner in your hand. It's a piece of medical equipment, designed for use in quiet, sterile environments. When you used it on yourself, it only produced a nearly inaudible, low-frequency hum and a soft click as the scan initiated. It's functionally silent.

However, it also produced a soft blue light that washed over your arm.

In the pitch-black alcove, activating it would be like lighting a flare. The light would spill out, painting the grotesque webs and humming machinery around you in a faint blue glow.

So, the scanner makes no noise that the creature could likely hear. The real question is, can it see light?









I turn on the terminal and, pointing the screen further down the corridor, turn the brightness up to max. i'm hoping to see if the creature follows it like a cat with a laser pen, or if it doesn't even notice.















Show thinking



A brilliant, calculated risk. A perfect test of the creature's senses without fully exposing yourself.

Your hand instinctively reaches for the datapad, the device you pulled the logs from... but your fingers find only a cold, dead screen. You remember with a flash of frustration that the battery gave out back in the Med Bay. The ship's main terminal is fixed to the wall in that room, useless to you here.

Your only portable light source is the medical scanner in your pouch.

It's not as bright as a datapad screen, but in this oppressive darkness, its soft blue glow would be unmistakable. The risk remains the same: you'll reveal a presence, and if the creature is sensitive to light, it might investigate. The question is whether it will investigate the light itself, or the Vexian holding it.

The Gloom Skitterer is still just a few meters away, its head twitching, antennae tasting the stale air. It hasn't moved on.

The log is updated. The decision is yours.









Is this alcove closed off, or does it continue away from the corridor in any fashion?













Show thinking



You press yourself deeper into the alcove, using your sensitive Vexian hands to feel your way around the cramped space in the near-total darkness.

The alcove is a dead end. It's a shallow recess, barely a meter deep. The back wall is a solid plate of metal, cold and unyielding. Your hands trace the thick, rubbery power conduits that snake up the walls and across the ceiling, feeling the low-frequency vibration of the ship's emergency power through them.

There is a small, square service hatch near the floor, but your fingers find no handle or release mechanism. It appears to be magnetically sealed or bolted from the other side.

There is no escape route through the alcove. It is only a hiding place. Your only way out is back into the corridor where the Gloom Skitterer is patiently waiting.

Your tactical situation remains unchanged. The creature is out there, and you are here, with a scanner and a sidearm. Your brilliant idea for a distraction is still on the table, but you'll have to be creative about how you use your limited tools.

The log is updated to reflect your assessment.









I turn my back to the corridor and huddle over the scanner, blocking all light. it can't scan the creature like this, but i test to see if i can find a mode that produces a long, strong laser from the end.

A brilliant and cautious move. You are using your environment and your intellect to mitigate risk.

You press yourself into the corner of the alcove, turning your back completely to the corridor. You create a small, dark cocoon with your body, huddling over the medical scanner. You activate it. A soft blue light illuminates your own chest and face, but from the corridor, you are still just a deeper shadow in an already dark space.

The scanner's default mode is a wide, gentle cone of light for bio-scanning. But this is a versatile piece of field equipment. It must have diagnostic or surgical modes. Your Vexian mind, naturally attuned to technology, begins to cycle through its subroutines, looking for any function that can focus the scanner's energy emitter into a tight beam. You're not trying to build a weapon, just a distraction.

This will require finesse and a deep understanding of the technology. It's an Intelligence (Technology) check.

The log is updated. The Gloom Skitterer continues its patient, terrifying patrol just outside your hiding spot.

Your Vexian mind, already familiar with the underlying principles of the device, finds the solution with elegant speed. Your fingers fly across the scanner's small interface, bypassing safety protocols and accessing the device's core calibration settings. You find the emitter controls for a high-intensity cellular cauterizer—a surgical function never intended for casual use.

With a final tap, the wide, soft cone of blue light collapses inward, re-emerging from the scanner's lens as a thin, brilliant blue line of light. It's not a weapon, but it's focused, bright, and perfectly silent. The scanner hums with a slightly higher frequency, its battery draining a little faster, but you now hold a perfect, silent distraction in your hands.

You've done it without making a sound and without revealing your position. The Gloom Skitterer is still just outside the alcove, its chitinous legs clicking softly on the deck plating as it patrols, still sensing that something is amiss.

You have the tool. Now, it's time for the plan.

The log has been updated. The next move is critical.

This is a high-stakes gamble, Dax. A brilliant piece of asymmetric warfare if it works.

You take a calming breath, the recycled air tasting stale and metallic. You turn off the scanner, plunging your small alcove back into total blackness. You press yourself against the forward edge of the recess, a mere shadow peering into the gloom of the corridor.

The Gloom Skitterer is still there, a darker shape in the darkness, its slow, patient clicking the only sound.

With one of your upper hands, you extend the modified scanner just past the edge of your cover. Your finger is poised on the activation stud. You aim towards the floor, a few meters in front of the creature.

Now, you must execute the plan with surgical precision. The goal is to create a moving point of light that captures the creature's attention and leads it, step by step, back toward the open door of the Med Bay, without ever revealing the source of the beam.

This requires immense control and a steady hand. It will be a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

Your hand is as steady as a surgeon's. You activate the scanner. A tiny, brilliant blue dot appears on the floor just in front of the Gloom Skitterer.

The creature's reaction is instantaneous and bizarre. It doesn't "see" the light, but its twitching antennae lock onto the point of focused energy. It lets out a low, inquisitive chitter. It is utterly fascinated.

With the delicate touch of a master puppeteer, you begin the lure.

You flick the blue dot a meter back towards the Med Bay. The creature scuttles after it, its bladed legs surprisingly quiet now that it's focused. You drag the dot in a slow, tantalizing arc. The Skitterer follows, its eyeless head tracking the beam's path perfectly. It moves past your alcove, so close you can smell the sweet, metallic scent of its carapace. You don't dare breathe.

Step by step, you lead the alien hunter back into the room you just escaped. You dance the blue dot onto the far wall of the Med Bay, right over the shattered diagnostic bed. The Gloom Skitterer stalks inside, fixated, clicking with what sounds almost like curiosity.

The plan has worked beyond your wildest expectations. The predator is now the puppet, and you hold the strings. The corridor ahead of you, leading to the Central Hub, is now clear.

The log has been updated. You have a monster in a box, and a clear path forward. The choice is yours.

Show thinking



An excellent thought. Knowledge is power, and any data on this creature could be the key to survival.

You have to make a choice. The scanner is currently in its modified "laser pointer" mode. To get a biological reading, you'll need to switch it back to its default "bio-scan" setting.

Doing so will cause two things to happen:

The focused blue dot mesmerizing the creature will vanish.

It will be replaced by a wide, soft cone of blue light emanating from your position in the alcove.

You can attempt to do this quickly—a rapid switch, a one-second scan, and then shut it off—but there's a significant risk. If the creature reacts to the sudden change in light, it will see the glow coming directly from your hiding spot.

The potential reward is a complete biological and tactical breakdown of the Gloom Skitterer. The risk is immediate, furious discovery.

This high-pressure maneuver will require a Dexterity (Stealth) check to perform the scan without giving away your position.

The log has been updated. The creature is still staring at the wall where the blue dot used to be, confused by its sudden disappearance. You have a brief window.

Your Vexian fingers, usually so precise, feel clumsy and slow under the pressure. You successfully switch the scanner back to its bio-scan mode, but in your haste to get a reading, you lean a fraction too far out of the alcove.

The wide, soft cone of blue light flashes on—not in the middle of the room, but directly from your hiding spot.

The Gloom Skitterer, which had been confused, snaps its head towards you. Its antennae lock onto your position. There is a moment of terrible stillness. Then, it rears up on its back legs and unleashes a piercing, high-frequency shriek that echoes painfully down the metal corridor.

You have been discovered.

Just before you instinctively flinch back, the scanner beeps, the one-second scan completed. Then the creature lowers itself and charges, its serrated legs scrabbling for purchase on the deck plating, covering the distance between you with terrifying speed.

A new section flashes onto your Adventure Log as the data from the scanner is automatically added.

It's time to fight. I have rolled for initiative. Your high Dexterity gives you the edge. You get to act first.

Your heart hammers against your ribs as the creature's shrieks intensify. There's no time to think, only to act. Your four hands become a blur of motion within the cramped confines of the alcove.

Two hands keep the dead datapad ready. Your other two scramble against the wall, feeling for anything, anything, that can serve as a tool. The metal conduits are smooth, the wall plates are flush... but then your fingers catch on a jagged edge. A piece of a service panel, sheared off in whatever disaster befell this ship, is sticking out from the wall. With a sharp twist, you wrench it free. It's a crude, sharp shard of metal. It will have to do.

Now for the critical part. You have one chance to turn this piece of junk into a thermal grenade. You need to drive the metal shard into the datapad's lithium-ion power cell with enough force and precision to cause a catastrophic, violent energy release. A clumsy strike will do nothing. A perfect one might just save your life.

This is a high-risk, high-reward maneuver that requires technical knowledge under extreme duress. It will be an Intelligence (Technology) check.

There is no hesitation. As the monster lunges, your mind becomes a razor-sharp instrument of survival. You know the exact structural weakness of the datapad's power cell. You know the precise angle and force required.

With a flick of your wrist, you ram the metal shard deep into the datapad's casing.

The effect is instantaneous and violent. The dead device screams to life with a high-pitched whine. A shower of blue sparks erupts from the puncture point, and with your other hand, you shove the now-unstable device directly into the path of the charging Gloom Skitterer.

The datapad detonates.

It's not a concussive blast, but a focused release of thermal energy. A blinding flash of white light is accompanied by a wave of searing heat and the sharp, acrid smell of vaporized electronics.

The creature, with its thermal vulnerability, is caught point-blank. It shrieks—a sound far more agonized and pained than its earlier cry of aggression. The blast flings it backward, and it crashes into the far wall of the corridor, its sleek black carapace scorched and smoking.

You have survived the initial charge. The creature is wounded, thrashing on the floor, but it is not dead. The immediate threat is over, but the fight is not.

It is now the Gloom Skitterer's turn. Wounded and enraged, it ignores its injuries and pushes itself back onto its serrated legs. It can't charge, but it can still act. It lowers its head and spews a thick, viscous stream of the same web-like substance from its maw, aiming to trap you in your alcove!

This is an attack against your Dexterity. You must try to dodge it. A Dexterity Saving Throw is required.

I have updated the log. I will roll for you.

You react in a blur, pressing yourself flat against the back wall of the alcove just as the projectile web smacks against the opening. Thick, sticky strands cover the entrance, sealing you in. You are not hit, but you are now trapped behind a gooey, semi-translucent barrier.

It is your turn again. The creature is wounded and hissing 10 meters away. You are trapped in the alcove.

What do you do?









If the scanner has any life left, i try to figure out what this goo is.

i assume the shard of metal is still inside the datapad? i did ram it in pretty deep.

if the scanner's dead... i try to shoot the goo, intentionally in the direction of the monster, so as to further intimidate it with extremely loud, aggressive sounds. but dax does suck with guns...















Show thinking



Your mind races, processing the new tactical reality.

First, the datapad. You glance out through the translucent parts of the web. The datapad is a mangled, smoking piece of slag halfway down the corridor, fused to the deck plating where it detonated. The shard of metal is buried within its molten core. It is no longer a tool; it's just debris.

Next, the scanner. You pull it from your pouch. The screen flickers with a LOW POWER warning, but it activates. You press it against the sticky web barrier. The device hums, its light struggling, and for one agonizing second, it analyzes the alien substance before the screen goes dark for the final time. It's dead. But not before it gives you its last secret.

A new section uploads to your Adventure Log's memory.

Finally, the sidearm. With the scanner dead and the creature waiting, your options have narrowed to one. You know from the scan that standard ballistics are useless against its armor, but the sound... the creature relies on sound. A gunshot in this confined metal tube will be deafening.

You unholster the weapon. It feels alien in your hand, a crude instrument of noise and violence. You take aim at the web, angling the shot so the bullet will pass through and ricochet down the corridor towards the monster, maximizing the chaotic noise. You've never been a marksman. This is pure improvisation.

This will be a Dexterity (Attack Roll). Your lack of experience with firearms will make this a difficult shot.

You may not be a soldier, but your Vexian dexterity gives you a natural, intuitive control. You brace yourself, grip the weapon with three hands for stability, and squeeze the trigger.

The result is apocalyptic.

A deafening CRACK-BOOM shatters the silence, a physical wave of sound that slams against your entire body. The muzzle flash is a blinding star in the darkness, and the unfamiliar weapon kicks hard in your grasp.

The solid slug tears through the web barrier like it's paper. But it's the secondary effect that changes everything. The scanner told you the web was flammable. The kinetic energy and friction from the bullet's passage act as a spark.

The entire web barrier ignites instantly.

A wall of roaring, orange flame erupts in front of you, consuming the alien polymer with a hungry, hissing roar and filling the corridor with thick, acrid smoke.

The effect on the Gloom Skitterer is devastating. Already wounded and relying on its sensitive hearing, the gunshot is pure agony. It convulses, shrieking a pain-choked cry that is drowned out by the roar of the fire. The sudden flash and wave of heat from the burning web is the final straw.

The creature turns and flees. You hear its bladed legs scrabbling frantically down the corridor, away from you, away from the fire and the noise, its panicked clicks fading into the distance.

The immediate combat is over. You won.

But now you have a new problem. The alcove exit is a sheet of fire. The corridor's emergency sprinklers haven't activated, and the fire is spreading slowly along the remaining webs on the walls. The path to the Central Hub is currently a furnace.

The log has been updated. The creature is gone, but the path forward is blocked by flames. What do you do, Dax?









Hahaha shit. okay i figure one of these pipes in the alcove may be a life support water pipe, or engineering coolant, or something. i should be able to feel for liquid.

how to get it out though... if i try to yank on one, you're gonna make me str roll aren't you... hmm...

alright - dax feels around for a pipe containing liquid that hopefully isn't too thick so he can yank it out and try to douse the alcove, ideally also cause a little river down the corridor















Show thinking



Excellent deduction, Dax. You're using your environment and your technical knowledge to fight back.

The heat from the burning web is intense, and the thick, black smoke is already making your eyes water and your lungs burn. You turn your back to the fire, pressing yourself against the humming conduits in the alcove. You have seconds before the smoke becomes overwhelming.

Your four hands move with desperate speed, tracing the thick, insulated pipes. Some are warm with power, others are inert, but then your fingers lock onto one that is distinctly, shockingly cold to the touch. It's a high-pressure coolant line for the ship's systems. This is your solution. If you can break it open, the sudden release of supercooled fluid should be more than enough to handle the fire.

But identifying the pipe is only half the battle. Tearing a reinforced, pressurized conduit from its wall mountings is an act of brute force. You are a scout, not a brawler. This will be difficult.

You find a junction where you can get some leverage, wrap all four of your hands around the frigid pipe, and plant your feet. This will require a Strength (Athletics) check. Your low Strength will be a major factor.

The log has been updated. The fire roars behind you. The fate of this corridor, and your path forward, depends on this single act of raw power.

You pour every ounce of your being into the effort. Adrenaline surges through you, and for a heart-stopping moment, you feel the pipe groan under the strain. The metal creaks, the bolts securing it to the wall shriek in protest... but they hold.

Your grip slips. The pipe remains firmly attached to the wall, and the effort has cost you precious seconds.

The fire roars in triumph. The smoke is no longer an annoyance; it's a physical presence. A thick, black, choking cloud fills the alcove, stealing the air from your lungs. Your vision blurs, and a violent coughing fit wracks your body.

The inferno is now impassable. Your clever plan has failed, and this small hiding place is rapidly becoming a deathtrap. You are beginning to suffocate.

You must escape the smoke. This will require a Constitution Saving Throw to resist the worst of its effects as you move.

It was a desperate, panicked retreat, and you made it just in time. The Constitution save was the roll to see how well you endured the smoke while legging it back here. You failed the roll, which is why you took the 2 points of damage.

You're now on the floor of the Med Bay, the door sealed against the inferno. The air here is thin and tastes of ozone, but it's breathable. Your lungs burn, a painful reminder of your failed gamble.

You have a moment to think, to reassess.

Your Health: You are wounded (7/9 HP).

Your Path: The way to the Central Hub and Engineering is a wall of fire. You need another route.

Your Tools: The medical scanner is dead. The sidearm has 5 rounds remaining.

Your Intel: You know the creature is vulnerable to heat and sound. You know its webs are flammable and turn brittle in the cold. This is invaluable information.

You push yourself into a sitting position, your back against the cold cryo-pod you woke up in. The red emergency lights still pulse, but they seem calmer now, less urgent. The immediate danger has passed, but you are trapped.

It's time for a new plan. The terminal is still here. The rest of the Med Bay is still largely unexplored.

What do you do?









Look around the medbay for something to cure me. not sure what, don't think dax would know either. oxygen mask? lung gel?













Show thinking



A sound instinct. This is a Med Bay, after all. There must be something here to treat your injuries.

Pushing through the pain in your lungs, you get to your feet and begin a systematic search of the room. You ignore the shattered diagnostic bed and the sparking, dead equipment, focusing on anything that looks functional or sealed.

Your eyes land on a reinforced, wall-mounted cabinet with a universal red medical cross stenciled on its front. The label beneath it reads EMERGENCY TRAUMA & RESPIRATORY KIT. This is it.

However, a small digital keypad next to the handle is dark and unresponsive. The entire unit is dead, cut off from the ship's emergency power grid.

But your technically-inclined eyes notice two things:

The cryo-pod you woke up in is still humming softly, its internal battery clearly holding a significant residual charge.

The medical cabinet has an auxiliary power port right next to the dead keypad.

Tucked into a storage bin beneath the active cryo-pod is a coiled, portable power conduit—a heavy-duty cable with magnetic couplings on both ends.

The solution is clear, but rerouting emergency power, even on this small scale, requires a delicate touch. A power surge could fry the lock or, worse, drain the cryo-pod's battery for good. You'll have to carefully jury-rig a power connection to get that cabinet open.

This will be an Intelligence (Technology) check.

I have updated the log. Your potential salvation is locked in a box, and you are the only one who can open it.

Your movements are economical and precise. There's no fumbling, no hesitation. You connect the power conduit to the cryo-pod's auxiliary port, and a soft hum tells you the connection is stable. With your other hands, you gently attach the other end to the medical cabinet.

The keypad flickers to life, its green LEDs a welcome sight in the dim red light. With a soft click, the magnetic lock disengages, and the cabinet door swings open with a quiet hiss.

Inside, nestled in sterile foam, is exactly what you need. You find a single, sealed auto-injector labeled PRS-7: PULMONARY REPAIR STIM. The instructions are simple pictograms: press to the chest, inject, breathe.

You don't hesitate. You press the device against your torso. There's a sharp hiss of compressed gas, and a sudden, intense cold spreads through your chest. For a moment, it's almost worse than the smoke, but then, like a miracle, the burning in your lungs vanishes. The pain is gone, and you can take a deep, clean breath for the first time since the fire.

You have healed yourself. Your HP is restored to 9 / 9.

The stim injector is now depleted, a single-use device. But you are whole again. The fire still rages in the corridor outside, a problem that raw health cannot solve. You need a new path. The terminal, with its ship-wide schematics, hums patiently, waiting for your next command.

The log has been updated to reflect your renewed condition.

A thorough search is a wise move. The single stim-injector was just the most obvious item. Now that the immediate panic has subsided, you take a moment to carefully catalogue the contents of the cabinet.

Most of it is highly specialized surgical equipment and chemical vials you don't recognize. But nestled amongst the complex medical gear, you find three items that are clearly designed for field use and are immediately useful.

Two Synth-Flesh Applicators: These are small, palm-sized devices. The pictogram shows one being pressed against a deep gash, which then seals over with a layer of synthetic skin. They look like a more robust, general-purpose healing solution.

(Game Effect: Restores 4 HP each. Action to apply.)

One Adrenal Booster: A much smaller, more aggressive-looking injector filled with a volatile-looking amber liquid. The warning label features a lightning bolt icon and a rapidly beating heart. This is a combat stimulant, designed to push a user past their physical limits for a short time.

(Game Effect: For 1 minute after use, you have Advantage on all Dexterity checks and saving throws. When the effect ends, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.)

One Cryo-Foam Canister: A pressurized canister, cold to the touch, with a wide dispersal nozzle. The label indicates it's for instantly treating severe burns by flash-freezing the affected area. It contains a rapidly expanding blue foam. This item clicks with the information you learned about the web's vulnerability to cold.

(Game Effect: Sprays a cone of super-cooled foam. Can be used to extinguish fires or exploit cold-based weaknesses.)

You carefully pack these new tools into the empty pouches on your utility belt. You are now healed, re-armed with tactical options, and ready to face the ship again.

But the fundamental problem remains. A wall of fire, fed by the alien webs, still separates you from your objective. You need a new route.

The terminal, with its complete map of the U.E.S. Wanderer, waits for you.

The log has been updated with your new inventory. What's your next move, Dax?









Okay, terminal time, let's see where i can go. corridor behind is a firewall in one direction and has a wounded but probably very angry demon creature somewhere in the opposite direction.

dax looks very thoroughly over the schematics for alternative routes such as maintenance tunnels

You approach the terminal, the cool blue light a familiar comfort. With your objective clear, you dive back into the ship's schematics, your fingers flying across the console. The main arteries of the ship are useless to you now; you need to find the capillaries, the forgotten paths.

You filter the display, peeling back layers of the ship's architecture—main corridors, power conduits, crew quarters—until only the skeletal framework of service routes remains. Your Vexian eyes scan the intricate network of maintenance shafts, ventilation ducts, and Jefferies tubes. And then you see it.

It's a narrow service conduit, barely wide enough for a single person, labeled CS-03: Coolant Systems Maintenance. It's not meant for travel, but for droids and engineers. And its origin point is right here. In this room.

The schematic shows the conduit's path:

Entrance: A maintenance hatch located on the aft wall of the Med Bay.

Path: It runs directly through the ship's superstructure, completely bypassing the fire in Corridor Gamma-7.

Exit: It emerges into a small, secondary storage closet directly adjacent to the Central Hub.

It's a perfect, stealthy alternative. The only problem is the entrance. According to the schematics, the hatch is located behind the Med Bay's primary bio-waste disposal unit—a heavy, sealed metal cabinet that's currently flush against the wall.

You turn from the terminal and look at the unit. It's a featureless slab of metal, easily weighing a few hundred kilograms. There's no obvious way to move it. The hatch is completely inaccessible. You'll have to find a way to get that unit out of the way first.

This will require a thorough examination of the unit and the surrounding area to find a release mechanism or override. A classic case of figuring out how the machinery works. This is an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Of course. Brute force is a clumsy, inefficient solution. You are a Vexian Tech-Scout. You solve problems with your mind.

You ignore the main body of the disposal unit and instead use all four of your hands to trace the seams where it meets the floor and the wall. Your sensitive fingers detect a faint vibration, a low-frequency hum of magnetic energy. The unit isn't just heavy; it's actively clamped to the deck plating for stability and sanitation.

Following the energy signature, you trace a nearly invisible conduit to a small, forgotten service panel a few meters away, half-hidden behind a bank of dead monitors. You pry the cover open. Inside is not a complex lock, but a single, robust manual lever labeled BIO-SEC: MAG-CLAMP RELEASE.

With a grunt of effort, you pull the lever down. There is a deep, satisfying THUNK as the electromagnets in the floor disengage. The heavy unit settles with a soft groan. It is now resting on a set of internal, retractable casters. Still heavy, but no longer immovable.

You easily push the massive cabinet aside, its wheels gliding smoothly over the deck. Behind it, just as the schematics promised, is a circular, reinforced maintenance hatch with a large, spoked valve wheel at its center. It looks like it hasn't been opened in years.

The way is open. The air inside the Med Bay is growing stale, and the distant roar of the fire is a constant reminder that you are on borrowed time.

I have updated the log. Your escape route is waiting.

An excellent tactical consideration. A simple escape isn't enough; you need to ensure you're not followed.

You pause, your hand hovering over the cold valve wheel of the hatch. Your gaze sweeps across the Med Bay, your mind working through the strategic possibilities. The most obvious, and most effective, solution is sitting right in front of you.

The Bio-Waste Disposal Unit.

You just moved the several-hundred-kilogram cabinet away from the wall. Its sheer mass is the perfect barricade.

A plan forms in your mind, simple but effective:

Open the maintenance hatch.

Climb inside the dark, narrow conduit.

From just inside the tunnel, use your Vexian limbs to reach out and push the heavy disposal unit back into its original position, covering the hatch completely.

You won't be able to re-engage the magnetic floor clamps from inside the tunnel, but the dead weight of the cabinet alone will be a formidable obstacle for almost any creature. It won't be a permanent seal, but it will buy you precious time. It's the best you can do.

The plan is set. You have a way in, and a way to secure the entrance behind you. The fire roars in the distance, a constant, pressing threat.

It is time to act. What do you do?

I have updated the log with your new objective.









Let's do it

With your plan set, you act.

All four of your hands grip the cold, spoked valve wheel. You plant your feet, brace yourself, and turn. The mechanism is stiff, groaning with years of disuse, but with a final surge of effort, it gives way. A series of heavy locking bolts retract with a satisfying thunk-thunk-thunk. With a final push, the heavy circular door swings inward, revealing a pitch-black, cylindrical tunnel.

A gust of stale, metallic air, cold and unused, washes over you. This tunnel has been sealed for a long time.

You don't hesitate. You clamber inside. The conduit is just as the schematics described: a cramped, dark tube filled with pipes and cables, barely wide enough for you to crawl through. You turn around just inside the entrance, your back to the darkness, and face the Med Bay one last time.

Now for the final step. You reach out with your four long limbs, find purchase on the heavy bio-waste unit, and push.

This is a test of raw strength, pushing a massive, awkward object from a compromised position. This will require a Strength (Athletics) check.

It's no use.

Your four arms strain, the muscles in your slender frame burning with the effort. The heavy cabinet groans, its casters scraping as it moves a few agonizing centimeters across the floor. But the angle is wrong, your position inside the cramped conduit is too compromised. You have no leverage.

With a final, desperate shove, your footing slips on the smooth metal of the tunnel floor. The cabinet slides back to its position, leaving the circular hatch wide, gaping, and completely unsecured.

The barricade plan has failed. The door behind you remains open, an unsecured entrance into this dark, forgotten passage.

You are now fully inside the maintenance conduit. It is utterly black, the only light being the faint, pulsating red glow from the Med Bay behind you. The air is cold and still, carrying the scent of dust and ozone. The distant roar of the fire is a low hum at your back.

From the darkness ahead of you, you hear a new sound. A slow, rhythmic drip... drip... drip of liquid hitting a metal surface.

You have two choices: remain here by the open hatch, exposed, or press forward into the unknown blackness of the conduit, towards the sound.

I have updated the log. Your escape is now a far more dangerous proposition.

A desperate, high-risk, high-reward gambit. A classic Tech-Scout solution—when brute force fails, use physics.

You peer back out of the conduit. The Med Bay is bathed in a pulsating red glow. Your target is the small, recessed service panel across the room, and inside it, the manual lever you pulled down moments ago.

The plan is audacious: fire a single, perfectly aimed shot from your sidearm. The goal isn't to destroy the mechanism, but to use the bullet's kinetic energy to slam the heavy manual lever back up into its "locked" position, re-engaging the magnetic clamps and sealing the bio-waste unit in front of the hatch.

This is an incredibly difficult shot.

You are in an awkward, braced position inside a narrow tube.

Your target is small and partially obscured within its housing.

A miss could ricochet wildly or destroy the mechanism entirely.

This will be a Dexterity (Attack Roll). Due to the extreme difficulty of the shot, you will be rolling with Disadvantage. (This means I will roll two d20s for you, and we will take the lower of the two results.)

The sound is a physical blow in the narrow tunnel, and the muzzle flash momentarily paints the conduit in stark white and black. The bullet screams across the Med Bay.

It is a hair's breadth off target.

Instead of striking the lever, the slug smacks into the hardened metal housing right next to it. A brilliant shower of orange sparks erupts, and the bullet ricochets harmlessly into the ceiling. The lever is untouched. The magnetic clamps remain disengaged.

You have failed.

The only results of your audacious plan are a deafening noise that has undoubtedly advertised your exact location to anything on this deck, and one less bullet in your sidearm. The hatch behind you is still wide open.

From far down the corridor outside the Med Bay, you hear an answering shriek. It is the Gloom Skitterer. It is wounded, but it is alive, and it knows exactly where you are. You hear the frantic, chitinous click-clack of its legs as it begins to race back towards the Med Bay.

Your four limbs find purchase on the smooth, cold metal as you scramble forward, a spider in a tube. The only guide is the rhythmic drip... drip... drip... getting louder with every meter. You have to move fast, but any loud noise will be a death sentence, leading the creature straight to you in this confined space.

You come upon the source of the sound. A thick coolant pipe running along the ceiling has a hairline fracture. A viscous, fluorescent green liquid weeps from the crack, falling a meter to the metal floor below with a steady, echoing plink. The floor around the small, growing puddle is slick and treacherous.

This is the point of no return. You must get past this noisy, slippery hazard without adding a sound of your own, and you have to do it now.

This is a desperate scramble in the dark. It all comes down to a Dexterity (Stealth) check.

I have updated the log. The frantic clicking of the Skitterer is just outside the Med Bay now. The hunt has reached its terrifying climax.

There is no sound. There is only motion.

Just as the frantic click-clack of the Gloom Skitterer enters the Med Bay behind you, you become a phantom. Your four limbs find silent purchase on the pipes and conduits lining the walls of the tunnel, allowing you to bypass the slick, dripping puddle on the floor entirely. You move like a ghost, a perfect synthesis of speed and silence, your Vexian grace honed to a razor's edge by pure terror.

You are halfway past the leak when the Skitterer reaches the hatch. A hulking, wounded silhouette, it blocks the faint red light from the Med Bay. It pauses, its eyeless head twitching, its antennae tasting the air. It can smell you. It knows you are in here.

But it can also hear. It hears the steady, rhythmic, maddening drip... drip... drip of the coolant echoing from the darkness ahead.

The creature hesitates. This confined space is a tactical disadvantage. It was just wounded by fire and deafened by a gunshot. The clear, repeating sound from the darkness ahead is a distraction it cannot ignore. Is that you? Is it a trap?

Its hesitation is your salvation.

You don't wait for it to make a decision. You continue your silent, desperate crawl, putting as much distance as possible between you and the monster. The tunnel ahead begins to resolve itself. Up ahead, you see a faint light filtering through a heavy metal grate. The exit.

You have made it. You are alive.

I have updated the log. You have reached the end of the maintenance conduit. The enraged hunter is behind you, confused but not gone. Freedom is just beyond the grate.









A massive grate that's gonna be loud as all hell? grate. ( ha ha )

running out of ammo but i think i need to do the bullet trick again. this time, at the same time as opening the hatch, i fire down the tunnel hoping the cacophony of sound stuns it a little longer.

A symphony of violence and distraction. It's audacious. It's desperate. It's pure Dax Stargazer. If you can pull this off, it will be the greatest escape of your short, confusing life.

You reach the end of the conduit. The light filters through a heavy, rusted iron grate, bolted into the ceiling of what looks like a small storage closet below. Your plan is a complex, perfectly timed sequence of chaos. You need to tear the grate free and fire the sidearm in the same split second, letting the gunshot's thunderous echo mask the shriek of tortured metal.

You position yourself, your lower limbs braced against the sides of the tunnel. One of your upper hands grips the cold, rusted handle of the grate. Your other hand raises the sidearm, aiming it back down the dark tube towards the confused monster.

This is a maneuver that requires every ounce of your physical and mental fortitude. You are performing two strenuous actions at once, a coordinated explosion of effort. It all comes down to the raw, explosive power you can exert in a single moment.

This will be a Strength (Athletics) check.

It is a singular moment of perfect, violent synchronicity.

Your finger squeezes the trigger. BOOM! The gunshot is a physical concussion in the narrow tube, a thunderclap of sound and fury directed straight at the approaching monster. In that same instant, you heave upwards with every fiber of your being.

Adrenaline sings in your veins. The rusted bolts holding the grate shriek in protest and then SNAP! The entire heavy iron assembly tears free in your grasp.

Down the tunnel, the effect of the point-blank gunshot is devastating. The Gloom Skitterer, already relying on its hearing, is overwhelmed. It reels back, disoriented and stunned by the sheer volume of the blast echoing in the confined space.

You don't wait to see the result. The moment the grate comes free, you drop, tumbling through the opening and crashing onto the hard deck of a small room below. The heavy iron grate lands beside you with a deafening CLANG!

You've done it. You are out.

You scramble to your feet in a dusty, dimly lit storage closet. Shelves filled with spare uniforms and cleaning supplies line the walls. Above you is the dark, open square of the maintenance hatch you just escaped from. In front of you is a single, standard electronic door. According to the schematics, that door leads directly to the Central Hub.

You can hear the faint, confused clicks of the Skitterer from the tunnel above, but for the first time since you woke up, you are in a secure room with a closed door between you and the monster.

You are free. You are safe. For now.

I have updated the log. The path to Engineering is finally open.









How safe am i? the skitterer comes this way once it regains its senses, surely

You are absolutely right. This closet is a temporary reprieve, not a sanctuary. The open maw of the maintenance hatch in the ceiling is a constant, terrifying reminder of that. From it, you can hear faint, enraged clicks and scraping sounds. The Skitterer is recovering from the blast. It will come.

You scramble to your feet, ignoring the dust and the aches, and turn your full attention to the door. It's a standard ship's portal, a slab of reinforced metal currently sealed shut. Next to it is a large, circular, luminescent panel—the activation switch.

Your technically adept eyes immediately spot a secondary mechanism: a heavy-duty manual release lever just below the main panel, currently in the "unlocked" position. It seems to be a low-tech override. It's possible you could use it to lock the door from the other side, but you'd need to understand how it functions first.

You have two choices:

Haste: Slap the activation panel now. The door will hiss open, and you can bolt through it into the Central Hub, leaving the closet door to slide shut behind you, unsecured.

Caution: Take a few precious seconds to examine the manual lock mechanism. Understanding it now might allow you to secure it from the other side, buying you valuable time and creating a real barrier.

This quick diagnostic will require an Intelligence (Investigation) check to deduce the lock's function under pressure.

I have updated the log. The clicking from the vent above is getting slightly more coherent, more deliberate. The creature is regaining its senses.

Your mind, honed for exactly this kind of problem-solving, cuts through the panic. Your four hands move as one, tracing the workings of the door mechanism with practiced efficiency. One hand feels the heavy-duty actuator connected to the manual lever, while another taps the electronic panel, sensing the faint energy of its standby mode.

The solution is brilliantly, brutally simple. It's a low-tech failsafe.

The electronic panel controls the motor that slides the door. The manual lever, when thrown, physically disengages the motor and slams a heavy, hardened-steel bolt from the door into the frame. It's a deadbolt. A primitive, but incredibly effective, security measure.

You know exactly what you need to do:

Open the door electronically.

Get to the other side.

Reach back and throw the manual lever before the door fully closes.

If you time it right, the door will slide shut, and the physical bolt will slam home, sealing it mechanically. It will be locked from both sides, an impassable barrier.

Your moment of insight is shattered by a new sound from the ceiling hatch. A low, guttural hiss. It is followed by a scraping sound, like serrated claws finding purchase on the metal lip of the conduit.

It's coming down.

You have no more time for planning. It's time to run.

The die is cast. No more planning. Only instinct.

As the Skitterer's bladed forelimbs hook over the edge of the hatch, you slam your palm against the door panel.

WHOOSH! The door to the Central Hub slides open with a hiss of pressurized air, revealing a vast, dark chamber beyond.

In that same instant, the monster drops. It lands in a heap of wounded fury, its scorched carapace clattering on the deck. It sees you, lets out a piercing shriek, and lunges.

This is a mad dash for survival. You throw yourself through the closing doorway.

You're through. The door is still closing. The monster throws its full weight against it, trying to force its way through before it seals.

Now, for the final act. From your position on the floor, you reach back with all four arms, grabbing for the manual release lever on the other side of the door.

Just as the monster's horrifying head forces its way into the gap, your hands find the lever. You don't just pull it; you slam it home with every ounce of your desperate, adrenaline-fueled strength.

WHUMP-CHUNK!

The door slams shut, and the heavy deadbolt engages with the force of a hydraulic press. The monster's head is snapped back, and the door seals completely. A series of deep, shuddering BOOMS echoes through the metal as the enraged creature hurls itself against the now-impassable barrier. The sounds are followed by frustrated, furious shrieks that are, thankfully, muffled by the thick steel.

Silence.

You lie on the cool, dark floor of the Central Hub. The only sounds are your own ragged breaths and the faint, muffled tantrum of the monster you just locked away. You are safe. You have won.

You have finally reached the ship's nerve center. The Central Hub is a massive, circular chamber. A holographic star map flickers weakly in the center of the room, and multiple corridors branch off in every direction. One, marked with the universal symbol for engineering, is directly across from you.

Now, back to the U.E.S. Wanderer...

You're standing in the vast, echoing silence of the Central Hub. The frantic, muffled booming from the monster you trapped has finally stopped. For the first time, you have a moment to breathe, to think, to choose your own path.

The air is still, thick with the dust of long disuse. A holographic star map in the center of the room paints the darkness with faint, shifting constellations. Corridors branch off in every direction, but one, directly ahead, is clearly marked with the universal sigil for Engineering.

The path is clear. What do you do?


dax takes a moment to breathe and first looks around the room for anything that might aid him. in particular, though he doesn't like guns, he's found the bullet ricochet to be a very useful defense so far; he wants more ammo.

he also wants a way to charge his medical scanner again, though he's sure this can be solved in the engineering room.

Your mind cuts through the chaos with practiced ease. You ignore the obvious debris and instead focus on the strategic points of the room: security stations, emergency lockers, and defensible positions. Your eyes are drawn to a large, overturned command console near the corridor leading to the Crew Quarters. It's the only spot that offers significant cover.

You slip behind it. And you are no longer alone.

Slumped against the console is the body of a U.E.S. Wanderer security officer, clad in dark blue armor. Her face is pale and still. It's clear she made her last stand here. A quick, respectful search yields exactly what you were hoping for.

Ammunition: Holstered on her belt is a full spare magazine for the standard-issue sidearm. It clicks perfectly into a spare pouch on your own belt. You now have 8 more rounds available.

Multi-Tool: A versatile piece of engineering equipment is also on her belt. It contains a plasma torch, a sonic wrench, and a wire bypass tool. This will be invaluable for interacting with the ship's systems.

Datapad: Her hand rests on a datapad, its screen heavily cracked. It seems to be displaying a single, frozen log entry.

Furthermore, while examining her gear, you notice a faint green light nearby. Tucked behind the console is an emergency diagnostic port, still humming with a low, steady power feed from an independent battery. It's not much, but it's more than enough to slowly recharge your medical scanner or other small devices.

You have found everything you were looking for, and more. The path to Engineering remains open, but this fallen officer's last message may hold a vital clue.

You gently close the officer's eyes, a gesture whose meaning feels instinctual, ancient. A moment of silence in a dead ship for a fallen stranger. You then carefully pick up the datapad. The screen is a spiderweb of cracks, but one log entry remains, frozen in time.

SECURITY LOG - Cpl. Eva Rostova
It got Ramirez. I'm the only one left on this deck. The thing is blind, but its hearing is impossibly sharp. It's nesting in the vents... something about the heat from Engineering must attract it. I'm making for the Deck 3 Armory. If anyone finds this, the emergency override is my service number: 7-3-5-5. Don't let this ship become a tomb.

The words send a chill through you. You now have a vital piece of tactical information and a potential future objective. You carefully pocket the dead device, its potential as a makeshift weapon not lost on you. Nearby, you find another shard of sheared metal from a damaged console and stow it as well, completing your improvised kit.

The path to Engineering is still the most logical route, but Officer Rostova's warning about the vents adds a new layer of dread to the silence.

Your assessment of the situation is sharp and logical. The creature is indeed trapped, and its path back to you is long, arduous, and blocked by multiple obstacles. But the thought of it finding another way, another vent, another forgotten passage, spurs you to action.

You cross the silent, cavernous Hub, your soft footsteps echoing slightly. You approach the large, circular blast door that leads back towards Corridor Gamma-7 and the Med Bay.

As you get closer, you feel a faint, radiating heat. The door is sealed shut, its magnetic locks firmly engaged. A thin, black wisp of smoke curls lazily from beneath the door, carrying the acrid smell of the burning alien polymer. You can hear a faint, distant, crackling roar from the other side.

The way back is sealed by fire and steel. Your assessment is correct: for now, the creature from the conduit is contained.

The path to Engineering still waits for you across the Hub, its silence now feeling slightly less threatening.

You stand from your crouched position beside the fallen security officer, her datapad and the knowledge it contained now yours. The silence of the Central Hub is vast, broken only by the faint, ghostly hum of the holographic star map. You know your primary objective is Engineering, but Officer Rostova's last words have given you a new, tantalizing goal: the armory.

You move to the center of the Hub, scanning the circular array of command consoles. Most are dead, their screens black and cold. But one, a primary navigation terminal, still clings to life, its monitor a wash of flickering blue static.

Your Vexian fingers feel a flicker of familiarity as you interface with the damaged console. You bypass the error messages, your mind deftly navigating the corrupted directory structure. You type in a search query: //LOCATE: ARMORY, DECK 3.

The terminal whirs and clicks, and a partial schematic of the ship appears. A route is highlighted in faint green light, leading from the Central Hub to a primary lift, and from there, down one level to Deck 3. The armory is located in the security block, aft of the crew quarters.

However, a block of red text flashes insistently next to the armory's designation:

**STATUS: SEALED - QUARANTINE PROTOCOL 7355 ENGAGED**

The number is an electric jolt to your memory. 7-3-5-5. The override code Rostova left in her log. You now know where the armory is, and you have the key to open it.

The path to Engineering remains clear and unobstructed. The path to the armory is more complex and leads to a sealed, unknown situation. The choice is yours.

What do you do?






dax keeps the information about the armory in mind, just in case. but he hopes it doesn't come to that. he's never been a fighter, even with an alien creature sprinting towards him.

The thought of the armory is a cold weight in your mind. Rostova's last stand, the promise of more weapons... it all points to a future of violence that you feel ill-equipped to handle. You are a scout, a problem-solver, not a soldier. Restoring the ship is a puzzle; fighting its monsters is a nightmare. With renewed focus, you turn your back on the path to the armory and cross the vast, silent Hub.

The doors to Engineering are massive, reinforced plates of steel, but they glide open with a low hiss as you approach, their emergency power still functional. Cool, ozone-scented air washes over you as you step across the threshold.

You have entered the heart of the U.E.S. Wanderer.

Engineering is a cavernous, multi-story chamber. A colossal, cylindrical power core dominates the center of the room, reaching from the floor far up into the darkness of the ceiling. It is completely dark, its surface cold and inert. Catwalks and gantries crisscross the chasm at various levels, all shrouded in deep shadow. The only sounds are the low, rhythmic hum of emergency life support and the intermittent crackle of a sparking conduit somewhere above you. The only light comes from the red emergency strobes, casting long, distorted shadows that dance like ghosts.

Your eyes, however, are immediately drawn to a chillingly familiar sight. The large ventilation grates near the ceiling, each easily the size of a small shuttle, are covered in thick, glistening ropes of the same dark, web-like substance you encountered in Corridor Gamma-7. Officer Rostova's warning echoes in your mind: "...the heat from Engineering must attract it."

Directly in front of you is a large, semi-circular control console, its screens dark save for a single, blinking red error message. It seems to be the primary terminal for the entire engineering deck.

The heart of the ship is dead, and the signs of the creature that killed it are everywhere. The main control console is the logical place to start.

What do you do?






dax feels some familiarity in this room, a sense of 'home'. with the memory loss, he can't quite recall it exactly, but he's significantly more relaxed being in here than out there.

he's thinking two things:

1. how salvageable is the ship right now? is there any hope at all of getting it moving again, heading to somewhere safe?

2. if it's clear the ship itself isn't going to move, are there escape pods? and can we chill this engineering room to below freezing, sacrificing ship functionality as a whole, without disturbing the escape?

Despite the ominous, web-covered vents and the deep shadows, a strange sense of calm washes over you. The quiet hum of machinery, the logical layout of the conduits, the sheer complexity of the dormant engine—this place feels familiar. It feels like a place you belong. The fear that gripped you in the dark corridors subsides, replaced by a focused, analytical purpose.

You approach the main control console, your mind racing with the two most critical questions. You need a situation report. Is this ship a tomb or a lifeboat?

Your four hands hover over the dusty console. The single blinking error message on the main screen suggests a catastrophic failure, but you know that even the most wounded machine can be coaxed into giving up its secrets. You need to bypass the primary error, dive deep into the ship's diagnostic subroutines, and get a complete, ship-wide status report. This will be a true test of your technical skill, pushing the damaged terminal to its absolute limit.

This will require an Intelligence (Technology) check.

You are no longer just a survivor; you are an engineer. Your four hands dance across the dusty console, a flurry of precise, intuitive movements. You don't just bypass the error message; you dive into the system's core memory, pulling raw data from the ship's struggling electronic soul. The terminal flickers to life, not with its standard interface, but with streams of diagnostic code that you understand perfectly.

After a few moments of intense concentration, you have the full, terrible truth.

1. Ship Status: Critical, but Salvageable.

The Problem: The main reactor is not destroyed, but in emergency shutdown. The cause was a catastrophic failure in a key component called a Plasma Injector. It seems to have shattered, causing a power surge that fried the primary coolant loop—which is what started the fire in Corridor Gamma-7.

The Hope: The auxiliary power systems, life support, and crucially, the FTL Drive, are all offline but undamaged. The ship's diagnostic confirms that a single spare Plasma Injector is kept in the Engineering Storage Bay, located on the gantry one level below you.

Conclusion: The U.E.S. Wanderer is not a lost cause. If you can retrieve the spare injector and manually restart the coolant loop, you can bring the main reactor back online. The ship can be saved.

2. Contingency Plans: Escape is an Option.

Escape Pods: The diagnostic confirms that 6 of the 8 escape pods are fully charged and ready. However, their launch controls are located exclusively on the Bridge. They cannot be launched from here.

The Cryo-Weapon: You find the environmental controls for Engineering. Your theory is correct. You can override the safety protocols and divert all remaining coolant reserves to flash-freeze this entire chamber. The system gives you a stark warning: INITIATING L-7 CRYO-PURGE WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE DORMANT REACTOR CORE. Using this option would mean sacrificing the ship forever, but it would almost certainly neutralize any biological threat in this room.

You now have a complete picture. You have a clear, step-by-step path to saving the ship, and a clear path to abandoning it.

The first step on the path of repair would be to make your way down to the gantry below and access the Engineering Storage Bay to find that spare part.

What do you do?



== moved from gemini to claude hereafter, claude's story is more 'canon' if any conflicts exist ==

Current Situation
You stand in the vast, shadow-filled Engineering Bay. The massive reactor core looms above you like a dead heart. The webbed vents high above are thankfully quiet for now. The console's blue glow illuminates your face as you process the diagnostic data.
You have three clear paths:
Path A: Hero's Route - Descend to the storage bay below, retrieve the Plasma Injector, fix the ship. Risk: Unknown what's down there (that intermittent heat signature).
Path B: Survivor's Route - Head to the Bridge, launch an escape pod, abandon the Wanderer. Risk: Long journey through unknown sections of the ship.
Path C: Scorched Earth - Initiate cryo-purge now, kill everything (including possibly other survivors), doom the ship forever.
The ladder well to the storage level is about 10 meters away, a circular opening in the deck plating with rungs descending into darkness. Emergency lighting casts faint red circles every few meters down, but you can't see the bottom from here.
The terminal also shows a ship schematic. The route to the Bridge would take you back through the Central Hub, up a main lift two decks, through the Officer's Quarter corridor, and finally to the Bridge itself. Multiple unknown areas.
Your Engineering instincts are strong here. This feels like home, like a puzzle you were meant to solve. But your survival instincts are screaming warnings about that heat signature below.
What does Dax do?
(Also congrats on getting the save/load working! That was a journey!)

player: (wait wasn't the medical scanner charged? from a critical success? or am i 

claude: You're absolutely right! Looking back at the logs:
In the Central Hub, you found Officer Rostova's body and discovered an emergency diagnostic port behind the console that was still powered. From the Gemini transcript:
"Furthermore, while examining her gear, you notice a faint green light nearby. Tucked behind the console is an emergency diagnostic port, still humming with a low, steady power feed from an independent battery. It's not much, but it's more than enough to slowly recharge your medical scanner or other small devices."
So yes - you can plug your medical scanner into that port in the Central Hub to recharge it! But that means going back through the Hub to reach it. The scanner is currently dead in your inventory, but it could be recharged if you return to that console.
That's actually a great tactical consideration. The scanner could:

Detect life signs (find survivors or threats)
Analyze that heat signature below before you descend
Get more data on the alien biology if you encounter another creature

Do you want to:

Head back to Central Hub first to recharge the scanner
Go straight down to the storage bay without it
Take a different path entirely

What's Dax thinking?

player: ah shit, i didn't actually charge it hah. fuck.
okay, dax confirmed on the terminal exactly where the heat signature is coming from, in relation to him, this room, and the storage 

claude: You turn back to the console, your fingers dancing across the interface to bring up the thermal sensor array. The system is damaged, but functional enough to give you a clearer picture.
The display refreshes, showing a cross-section of Engineering:
Your Position: Main Engineering deck, at the primary console.
The Heat Signature: It's not in the storage bay itself. It's in the maintenance shaft that runs parallel to the ladder well, about halfway down between your level and the storage level below. The signature is stationary now, body-temperature, roughly human-sized. It's been moving intermittently - sometimes completely still for minutes, then shifting position slightly.
Storage Bay Status: The actual storage bay shows cold - no heat signatures, no movement. The Plasma Injector should be in a sealed cabinet down there.
The maintenance shaft has an access panel on each level. There's one here on your deck (currently sealed), and another in the storage bay below. Whatever's in that shaft could emerge at either level... or might just be hiding.
Your tactical situation is clearer now:

The thing in the shaft seems to be alive but not actively hunting
You could potentially bypass it by moving quickly down the ladder
Or you could investigate the maintenance panel on this level first
The storage bay itself appears clear

The engineering instincts in you note that if it's human-sized and body-temperature, it could be another survivor in hiding. Or it could be something else entirely wearing a human shape.
What's your move?

player: dax recalls the previous creature made a chitinous clicking sound before it was ever alerted to his presence. he attempts to listen out for the same sound, focusing in on it, locking out the other sounds of the 

claude: You close your eyes, letting your Vexian senses sharpen in the darkness. Your breathing slows. The background hum of the emergency generators fades. The distant groan of settling metal becomes white noise. You're listening for that specific sound - that wet, chitinous click-clack that haunted you through the corridors.
Roll for Perception to filter out the ship's ambient noise and detect any creature sounds.
Rolling Wisdom (Perception)...
d20 Roll: 16
Your Wisdom Modifier: +1
Total: 17 (Success!)
Your multifaceted ears, evolved for the subtle acoustic environment of Vexian caverns, parse the layers of sound with remarkable clarity.
You hear:

The steady thrum of life support
A faint drip of condensation somewhere above
The occasional spark from damaged conduits
Your own heartbeat

But NO chittering. No clicking. No scraping of chitin on metal.
Instead, from the maintenance shaft, you catch something else entirely: a soft, ragged breathing. Labored. Human or near-human. And underneath it, barely audible, a whispered mantra being repeated:
"...seven three five five... seven three five five... seven three five five..."
The same numbers from Officer Rostova's armory code. Over and over.
This isn't a Skitterer. This is a person. A survivor. And they sound like they're in bad shape - physically or mentally or both.
The maintenance access panel is 15 meters away, secured with a standard manual release wheel.
What does Dax do?

player: (ey, woah, appreciate it but ask me to roll, remember?)oh fuck. dax sneaks back into the hub as quick as he can to charge his med scanner and returns to the engi 

claude: You're right - let me fix that! I should ask you to roll, not roll for you.

You close your eyes, letting your Vexian senses sharpen in the darkness. Your breathing slows as you try to filter out the ship's ambient noise and focus on any telltale creature sounds.
Roll a Perception check (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to see what you can hear.
Once you tell me what you rolled, I'll let you know what Dax picks up!
But first - you mentioned sneaking back to the Hub to charge the scanner. Smart move! The trek back through the massive Engineering bay to the door is tense but uneventful. You slip into the Central Hub, finding Officer Rostova's body still where you left it behind the console. The emergency diagnostic port glows with that faint green light.
You plug in the medical scanner. It takes about 30 seconds to charge enough for basic functionality. The device hums back to life, its small screen showing a battery indicator slowly filling.
Now, returning to Engineering with your newly charged scanner, you pause at the threshold. That heat signature is still on the thermal readings, still in the maintenance shaft between levels.
Want to make that Perception check now to listen for what's in the shaft? Roll when ready!

player: (it was Perception check: 14 +1 = 

claude: Perception check: 15 (Success!)
Standing in the doorway of Engineering, your scanner charged and ready, you filter through the ship's cacophony of dying sounds. Your Vexian hearing picks up something that makes your blood run cold.
From the maintenance shaft, there's no chittering or clicking. Instead, you hear ragged, labored breathing - definitely humanoid. And underneath it, a barely audible whispered mantra:
"...seven three five five... seven three five five... seven three five five..."
Officer Rostova's armory code. Someone down there knows it. Someone who sounds hurt, terrified, or possibly losing their mind.
You now have your charged medical scanner in hand. The maintenance access panel is about 15 meters away from your position, a standard manual release wheel securing it. The thermal readings still show the figure hasn't moved from their position in the shaft between levels.
Your options are clearer now:

Use the scanner to get a reading through the maintenance panel (might tell you if they're injured, human, infected, etc.)
Open the panel and make contact
Ignore them and head straight down the ladder to the storage bay
Try to communicate through the panel first

What does Dax do?

player: dax tries to get an angle to scan them from a distance without being 

claude: You move with practiced stealth, keeping to the shadows cast by the massive reactor housing. The medical scanner's weight is reassuring in your hand - finally, a chance to know what you're dealing with before it knows about you.
The maintenance shaft has ventilation grates at regular intervals along the wall. You identify one that should give you a good angle while keeping you concealed behind a bank of cooling pipes. From there, you could potentially scan through the grate without revealing your position.
Getting there without making noise will require careful movement across the debris-strewn engineering deck.
Roll a Stealth check (d20 + your Dexterity modifier of +4) to see if you can get into position without alerting whoever's in the shaft.
What do you roll?

player: shit, Stealth check: 9 (rolled 

claude: Stealth check: 9 (Failure)
You begin creeping along the wall, using the cooling pipes for cover. Your four hands carefully place each step, avoiding the larger pieces of debris. You're halfway to the ventilation grate when your foot finds a section of deck plating that's come loose from its moorings.
CLANG
The metal plate shifts and bangs against its housing. The sound echoes through Engineering like a bell.
The breathing in the maintenance shaft stops instantly. Complete silence for three heartbeats. Then, a panicked scrambling sound - someone moving fast through the confined space, heading AWAY from you, deeper into the shaft system. You hear a muffled sob of terror and the continued frantic whisper, now faster, more desperate:
"Seven-three-five-five-seven-three-five-five-please-no-please-seven-three-five-five-"
They're moving toward the lower access panel - the one in the storage bay. If they exit there, they'll be right where you need to go for the Plasma Injector.
You could:

Race to the ladder and try to get down there first
Call out to identify yourself as friendly
Use the maintenance panel on this level to pursue through the shaft
Let them go and wait for them to clear the area

The medical scanner is still in your hand, unused. Whatever's in that shaft is terrified of you.
What does Dax do?

player: chase after them and attempt to get them to quiet down and recognise me as a 

claude: You sprint toward the ladder well, your four legs carrying you with Vexian speed. The panicked scrambling in the shaft is heading the same direction - down toward the storage bay.
"Wait!" you call out, trying to keep your voice calm and non-threatening. "I'm not going to hurt you! I'm Dax - I'm crew! Technical specialist!"
The scrambling doesn't stop. If anything, it gets more frantic. You reach the ladder and start descending quickly, trying to match their pace through the shaft.
"Listen to me!" you continue, your voice echoing in the ladder well. "I know about Rostova! I found her in the Central Hub - she gave me that code! Seven-three-five-five! I know about the armory!"
Roll a Persuasion check (d20 + your Charisma modifier of 0) to see if you can break through their panic and get them to recognize you as friendly.
As you're climbing down, you can hear them getting closer to the lower access panel. The storage bay is only seconds away for both of you.
What do you roll?

player: Persuasion check: 17 (rolled 

claude: Persuasion check: 17 (Success!)
The scrambling in the shaft suddenly stops. You hear ragged breathing, then a choked voice - female, young, terrified but trying to focus:
"R-Rostova? You... you found Rostova? Is she...?"
"She didn't make it," you say gently, still descending the ladder. "But she left her service number. She wanted someone to get to the armory. I'm here to help."
There's a long pause. Then the access panel below slowly, cautiously, creaks open. You reach the bottom of the ladder just as a figure tumbles out of the maintenance shaft onto the storage bay floor.
She's human, early twenties, wearing a torn engineering jumpsuit with the name "CHEN" on the patch. Her face is pale, streaked with grime and tears, and there's dried blood on her temple. She's clutching her left arm to her chest - it hangs at an wrong angle. She looks up at you with wide, terrified eyes that slowly focus on your Vexian features, then your uniform.
"You're... you're real," Chen whispers. "You're not one of those things. Oh god, I thought... I've been hiding for... I don't know how long. The things in the vents, they killed Martinez, they killed everyone, I saw them pull Martinez up into the—"
She's starting to hyperventilate, edging toward panic again.
You're in the storage bay now. The Plasma Injector cabinet is visible across the room. Chen needs medical attention, but she also might know crucial information about what happened here.
What does Dax do?

player: dax remembers he picked up an array of items from the med bay. he scans chen and does his best to render medical aid, though he's better at fixing machines than people. he tries to get info from her chatting as they 

claude: You kneel beside Chen, pulling out your medical scanner with one hand while rifling through your supplies with the others. "I'm going to help you," you say calmly. "I've got medical supplies. Just keep talking to me - tell me what happened while I work."
You activate the scanner, its blue light washing over Chen as she flinches instinctively.
Scanner readout:

Dislocated left shoulder
Mild concussion
Dehydration
Elevated stress hormones
No biological contamination detected

"This is going to hurt," you warn, pulling out one of your Synth-Flesh applicators. "But I need to reset your shoulder first."
"Wait, wait—" Chen gasps, but you've already positioned your four hands - two to hold her steady, two to manipulate the joint.
Roll a Medicine check (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to see how well you handle the medical treatment. Or if you'd prefer, you could use Intelligence instead, approaching it like an engineering problem.
While you prepare, Chen starts talking through gritted teeth: "Three days ago... maybe four? The Captain brought something aboard from a derelict we found. Said it was... was valuable salvage. But the container breached in the cargo bay. These things... they got Ramirez first. Then they spread through the vents."
She shudders. "Martinez and I sealed ourselves in here, but they found us. Pulled him right up into the vent. I've been hiding in the maintenance shaft since, drinking condensation, trying not to make a sound. There's... there's more than one. At least three, maybe more."
What do you roll for the medical treatment?

player: I rolled 11 on a d20, +1 so 

claude: Medicine check: 12 (Partial Success)
You grip Chen's shoulder, approaching it like a mechanical joint that needs realigning. "On three," you say. "One, two—"
You pull and rotate on two. The shoulder pops back into place with an audible crack. Chen screams, then slumps forward, gasping.
"You said three!" she wheezes.
"Works better when you're not tensed," you reply, already applying the Synth-Flesh applicator around her shoulder. The device hisses as it sprays a layer of artificial skin that hardens into a supportive mesh. It's not pretty - you've applied it a bit thick in some spots, thin in others - but it'll hold.
Chen flexes her fingers experimentally. "It... it works. Thanks."
As you tend to her head wound with your second Synth-Flesh applicator (you're now out), she continues:
"The things... Skitterers, Martinez called them. They hunt by sound. But there's something else too. Something bigger. I heard it once, moving through the main corridors. Heavy. Wet. The Skitterers went quiet when it passed."
She points toward the Plasma Injector cabinet. "That's what you're here for, right? To fix the reactor? Martinez and I tried to get to it, but..." she shudders. "The vents in here aren't webbed, but they're not sealed either. Every time we made noise, we heard clicking from above."
Sure enough, looking up, you see the storage bay's ceiling vents are clear of webbing but dark and open. The room has been quiet so far, but Chen's scream when you reset her shoulder was loud.
Chen struggles to her feet. "We should hurry."
What does Dax do?

player: dex asks chen if she can move, and what she has on her. similarly he shares what he has, and what he's experienced so far fighting one of the creatures.
he tells her of the two options they have - get the ship running and fly, or get into escape pods and ditch. knowing there's more monsters out there, dax wants to leave yesterday. but having found a survivor, he's worried about abandoning any others who might be out 

claude: Chen tests her shoulder, wincing but nodding. "I can move. Hurts like hell, but I'll manage." She pats her pockets, pulling out a few items:
"I've got a plasma torch from my engineering kit - almost dead though, maybe thirty seconds of charge left. A half-empty water bottle. And..." she produces a small data pad, "Martinez's personal log. He was tracking the creatures' movements before... before they got him."
You share your inventory with her: the sidearm (10 rounds), the cryo-foam canister, multi-tool, and dead datapad you turned into a bomb earlier. You quickly explain your encounter with the Skitterer - the fire vulnerability, how sound attracts them, the way you trapped one in the maintenance closet.
Chen's eyes widen. "You fought one alone? And survived?" She looks at you with new respect. "Martinez was military, and even he..." she trails off.
You explain the two options - fix the reactor or escape pods. Chen listens, then shakes her head.
"There are others," she says firmly. "Or there were. Dr. Yuen was alive two days ago - I heard her on the intercom trying to coordinate survivors. She mentioned gathering people in the Medical Bay, but the comms cut out. And..." she hesitates, "there's something else. Martinez suspected the Captain might still be alive on the Bridge. Sealed himself in when everything went to hell."
She looks at the Plasma Injector cabinet, then back at you. "If we fix the reactor, we get main power back. That means internal sensors, proper lighting, maybe even internal defenses. We could find other survivors easier. But if we run for the pods..." she swallows hard, "we might be leaving people to die."
The weight of command decision sits heavy. Chen adds quietly, "Whatever you decide, I'm with you. You saved my life. But Martinez kept saying - 'no one left behind.' He died believing that."
From somewhere above, very faint, you both hear a familiar sound: click... click... click...
The Skitterers know you're here.
What does Dax do?

player: fuck. FUCK. dax can't bring himself to consider the escape pods any more. at least not until they can get everyone on them. he has to keep the potential of freezing the entire ship in the back of his mind, in case things turn ugly.
dax tells chen the med scanner said she was dehydrated - encourages her to take a drink. then goes for the plasma 

claude: The moral weight settles on your shoulders. You're not leaving anyone behind if you can help it.
"Take a drink," you tell Chen firmly, gesturing to her water bottle. "Doctor's orders. Or, well, tech-scout with a medical scanner's orders."
She takes a few careful sips while you move toward the Plasma Injector cabinet. It's a standard industrial storage unit with a heavy magnetic lock - fortunately, it's on the emergency power circuit and still functional. Your multi-tool should be able to bypass it.
The clicking from above gets slightly louder. Multiple sources now - at least two, maybe three Skitterers tracking your position through the vents.
The cabinet is 5 meters away. Chen stays close behind you, her breathing controlled but tense. As you approach, you notice the floor around the cabinet has scratch marks - deep gouges in the metal, like something with claws tried to force it open but failed.
Your multi-tool has a plasma torch (for cutting), a sonic wrench (for loosening bolts), and a wire bypass tool (for electronic locks). The cabinet's lock is electronic with a manual override.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + your Intelligence modifier of +3) to efficiently bypass the lock before the Skitterers decide to drop through those vents.
The clicking is now directly overhead. Chen grips her nearly-dead plasma torch, ready to defend if needed.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 11 on a d20 +3, 

claude: Intelligence (Technology) check: 14 (Success!)
Your multi-tool's wire bypass clicks into the lock's access port. The cabinet's security is decent, but standard - you've worked with these systems before. Your fingers dance across the bypass tool's interface, rerouting power through the emergency circuit to trick the lock into thinking it received the proper authorization code.
Click-THUNK.
The magnetic seal disengages. The cabinet door swings open revealing the prize: a pristine Plasma Injector, still in its protective case. It's about the size of your forearm, a cylinder of reinforced glass containing a swirling, blue-white plasma core. Next to it sits a maintenance manual and a secondary stabilizer unit.
"Got it!" you whisper, carefully lifting the injector.
At that exact moment, a wet tearing sound comes from above. One of the vent grates is being pried open from inside. Black, viscous webbing begins to drip through the widening gap.
"Move!" Chen hisses, backing toward the ladder.
You have the Plasma Injector, but now you need to:

Get back up the ladder to Engineering (where you can install it)
Avoid or fight the Skitterers that are literally breaking through above you
Keep the fragile injector intact

The closest vent is about 4 meters away. The ladder is 10 meters. More tearing sounds indicate multiple vents are being compromised.
Chen raises her nearly-dead plasma torch. "Thirty seconds of charge. Your call - fight or run?"
What does Dax do?

player: dax tells her we can't fight. she said herself, soldiers can't even beat them. we just have to outsmart them.
he takes the busted datapad and jagged metal and prepares to rig up another makeshift grenade. he tells chen to get ready to run for the ladder and race up it. the timing has to be just right to buy enough for them to get to the top of the ladder and seal it back 

claude: You pull out the dead datapad and jagged metal shard, your hands already working on the familiar improvisation. "We run," you tell Chen firmly. "But we need a distraction first."
Chen nods, understanding immediately. "I'll cover the ladder. Go!"
Above, a Skitterer's eyeless head pushes through the vent, antennae twitching. Then another vent tears open 3 meters to your left.
You need to puncture the datapad's battery at just the right angle to create maximum thermal discharge - you've done this once before, but under pressure with multiple threats, it'll be harder.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to successfully create another thermal grenade quickly enough.
The first Skitterer drops to the floor with a wet thud, its blade-like forelimbs clicking against the deck. It's between you and the ladder now, head swiveling as it tastes the air.
Chen backs toward the ladder, keeping her plasma torch ready but not ignited yet - saving those precious thirty seconds.
"Whatever you're doing, do it fast!" she hisses.
The second Skitterer is squeezing through its vent. You've got seconds.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 14 on a d20 +3 for 

claude: Intelligence (Technology) check: 17 (Success!)
Your hands work with practiced precision despite the chaos. You've done this once - you can do it again. The metal shard punches through the datapad's casing at the perfect angle, right into the battery's sweet spot.
The device immediately starts whining, heating up fast.
"NOW!" you shout, hurling the improvised grenade between the first Skitterer and the ladder.
The datapad detonates in mid-air with a brilliant flash and a wave of searing heat. The Skitterer shrieks, reeling back from the thermal blast, its sensitive antennae overwhelmed.
"GO GO GO!"
Chen doesn't need to be told twice. She sprints for the ladder as the second Skitterer drops from the ceiling behind you. You clutch the Plasma Injector case to your chest and bolt after her, your four legs pumping.
Chen hits the ladder first, climbing with desperate speed. You're right behind her, using your multiple arms to climb faster than any human could. Below, the first Skitterer recovers, letting out an enraged shriek. You hear its claws scraping against the ladder's metal as it starts pursuing.
"The hatch!" Chen gasps, hauling herself up onto the Engineering deck. "There's an emergency seal!"
You scramble up, the Plasma Injector secure in one arm. Below, the Skitterer is climbing fast, maybe 3 meters down and closing.
Roll a Strength check (d20 + your -1 modifier) to help Chen slam the emergency hatch seal before the Skitterer reaches you!
The creature's blade-arms are reaching up through the ladder well...
What do you roll?

player: shit, I rolled 10 on a d20, -1 for 

claude: Strength check: 9 (Failure!)
You and Chen both grab the heavy emergency hatch, pulling with everything you have. But it's rusted, stuck from years of disuse. The metal groans but doesn't budge fast enough.
A bladed arm shoots up through the gap, missing your leg by inches! The Skitterer's head appears at the rim, mandibles clicking furiously.
"The torch!" you shout.
Chen doesn't hesitate. She ignites her plasma torch and jams it right into the creature's face. The thirty seconds of charge she mentioned goes fast - but it's enough. The brilliant blue-white flame sears into the Skitterer's head, and it shrieks, losing its grip and tumbling back down the ladder well with a heavy crash.
The torch sputters and dies just as you both finally wrench the hatch closed, spinning the manual lock wheel.
THUNK.
You can hear angry clicking and scraping from below, but the hatch is sealed.
Chen collapses against the floor, breathing hard. "That's it. Torch is completely dead now." She looks at the Plasma Injector case in your arms. "Please tell me that thing's intact."
You check - the case protected it perfectly. The injector is undamaged.
You're back in Engineering, main deck. The reactor core looms above. The console where you need to install the injector is 20 meters away. But now you have what you need to save the ship.
Chen struggles to her feet. "What now, boss?"
What does Dax do?

player: "now? now we make sure everything we do is as quiet as possible. between us we've escaped death three times now. i dunno how many lives you humans have, but vexians don't even have *this *many"
dax sneaks over to the consoles to get the plasma injector installed and running, though in a mode that runs silently at first - no sudden power-ups or the 

claude: Chen nods grimly. "Nine lives is just a saying. Pretty sure I've used most of mine today."
You both move in near-silence across Engineering, every footstep calculated. The massive reactor core hums its low, dormant song. At the main console, you carefully open the Plasma Injector case and examine the installation panel.
The reactor's injection port is accessible through a maintenance panel beneath the console. You'll need to:

Remove the shattered old injector
Install the new one
Manually restart the coolant loop
Bring the reactor online in staged increments to avoid power surges

Chen watches your back, eyes scanning the webbed vents above. "How long will this take?"
You assess the setup. "Ten minutes if nothing goes wrong. Maybe fifteen for a truly silent startup sequence."
The broken injector is a mess - crystallized plasma residue everywhere. You'll need to clean the housing before installing the new one. Your multi-tool should handle it, but working in near-darkness by console light will require precision.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to perform the delicate installation and calibration without triggering any alarms or power surges that might attract attention.
Chen whispers, "The vents have gone quiet. That's... probably not good."
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 17 on a d20 +3 for a 

claude: Intelligence (Technology) check: 20 (Critical Success!)
Your four hands move like a symphony of precision. This isn't just repair work - it's art.
You extract the shattered injector with delicate care, each crystallized fragment removed without a single clink. The housing is scored and carbonized, but your multi-tool's plasma torch - set to its lowest, quietest setting - cleans it perfectly.
Chen watches in amazement as you install the new Plasma Injector with movements so smooth it barely makes a whisper. The cylinder slides home with a soft, satisfying click.
Now for the masterwork: You access the reactor's startup subroutines and begin rewriting them on the fly. Instead of the standard emergency restart (loud, bright, sudden), you program a cascading slow-initialization sequence. Each system will come online individually, power ramping up in increments so gradual that the ship's acoustics won't even change.
"You're... you're programming a stealth restart," Chen whispers in awe. "I didn't even know that was possible."
The coolant loop begins cycling - not with its usual rushing whoosh, but with a gentle, barely audible flow. The reactor core's surface begins to glow, but so faintly it's like watching a sunset in extreme slow motion.
Stage 1 complete: Emergency power boosted by 15%
Stage 2 complete: Life support optimal
Stage 3 complete: Internal sensors coming online...
The console flickers with new data. You now have access to motion sensors throughout the ship. The results are... sobering:

3 Skitterers in Engineering vents (dormant)
2 Skitterers in Central Hub (active, moving)
1 unknown large biosignature in Cargo Bay
4 human life signs detected: You, Chen, one in Medical Bay (weak), one on the Bridge (stable)

Chen sees the readout. "Dr. Yuen made it to Medical. And the Captain's alive!"
Stage 4 initiating: Main power at 40% and rising slowly...
The ship is coming back to life under your hands, silent as a whisper.
What's the plan, Dax?

player: dax tells chen about the medbay... how he'd come from there... how there's an angry skitterer trapped between a hall of fire and... the room where dr. yuen is... dax doesn't think they have enough to get to the doctor and back, not without ruining any chance of moving forward to the 

claude: Chen's face falls as you explain the situation. The Medical Bay is cut off by fire on one side and a trapped, enraged Skitterer on the other.
"Dr. Yuen's trapped," Chen says quietly. "The sensors show she's weak. She might be injured, running out of supplies..." She runs a hand through her hair. "But you're right. We don't have the firepower to fight through multiple Skitterers. Not with 10 rounds and a cryo-foam canister."
She looks at the sensor display showing the Bridge. "The Captain has the escape pod controls. If we can reach him, we could launch a ship-wide evacuation alert, get everyone to the pods. But that means leaving Dr. Yuen alone even longer."
The reactor continues its silent climb. Stage 5 complete: Main power at 55%.
Chen studies the ship schematic. "Wait. With main power coming back, we might have options. The fire suppression systems should come online soon. We could vent the burning corridor to space if we reach the right controls. Or..." she points to a route, "there's an environmental control station one deck up. We could flood that entire section with halon gas - kills the fire, but also knocks out anyone without a mask."
The motion sensors flicker: the two Skitterers in the Central Hub are moving toward the Engineering door. They're investigating the subtle power changes.
"We need to decide fast," Chen whispers. "Dr. Yuen alone in Medical, or the Captain on the Bridge. Who do we save first?"
The weight of the decision hangs heavy. Both survivors need help. Time is running out.
What does Dax do?

player: dax thinks back to his time in the medbay. the door to the corridor was left open, as was the vent that led to the central hub maintenance closet. he asks chen, "spacing it would mean losing the doctor to the void, no?"
either way, it's the central hub that needs immediate attention. they'll not get far with the two creatures right outside the door. but the hub... the hub *is *sealed shut. 
dax asks chen to help him find a way to space the central 

claude: You think through the geometry of the ship. The Medical Bay door was indeed left open to the burning corridor, and that maintenance tunnel you escaped through... it leads right back to the Central Hub. Spacing the Hub would create a vacuum that would pull through those connections.
Chen's eyes widen as she realizes the same thing. "Oh god, you're right. The pressure differential would suck everything through those openings. Dr. Yuen wouldn't stand a chance."
She pounds her fist against the console in frustration, then forces herself to think. "Okay, okay. The Hub is sealed from this side, you're right. But those two Skitterers..." She pulls up the environmental controls on the console. "Wait. Look at this."
The schematic shows the Central Hub's atmospheric systems. "The Hub has emergency vent hatches in the ceiling - for exactly this scenario. But they're manually operated from inside the Hub itself, or..." she traces a pathway, "from the Bridge override controls."
The motion sensors ping: the two Skitterers in the Hub have settled near the Engineering door, seemingly waiting.
"There's one other option," Chen says quietly. "The Hub has an observation window looking out into space. Port side, reinforced transparisteel. If we could somehow break it..."
She looks at you. "Your cryo-foam. If we could get it on that window, the thermal shock might crack it. But we'd need to be in the Hub to do it, with those things."
Stage 6 complete: Main power at 70%. Internal comms system now available.
A new option appears on your console: ship-wide intercom.
What does Dax do?

player: dax tries not to panic. he recalls how important the cold is in fighting these things, reluctant to use such a useful close-combat defensive tool to blow a hole in the ship.
all the answers are in the bridge. (pause - does dax know how to get from engineering to the bridge? i 

claude: Yes! Earlier when you checked the terminal in the Central Hub, you mapped the route to the Bridge. From the Gemini logs:
The path to the Bridge from Engineering:

Exit Engineering into the Central Hub (currently blocked by 2 Skitterers)
From the Hub, take the main lift up two decks
Go through the Officer's Quarters corridor
Finally reach the Bridge

So you'd need to somehow get through or around those two Skitterers in the Hub first. The Bridge feels both tantalizingly close and impossibly far away.

You stare at the console, mind racing. The cryo-foam is too valuable to waste on breaking a window. Those creatures are vulnerable to cold - it might be your only real weapon against them.
"The Bridge has all the answers," you mutter. "Pod controls, environmental overrides, maybe even weapons systems."
Chen nods. "But those two Skitterers are literally camping our only door out."
The ship's intercom system glows ready on the console. You could try to contact the Captain or Dr. Yuen. You could also potentially use sound to lure the Skitterers somewhere else.
Stage 7 complete: Main power at 85%.
A new alert appears: "FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS: ONLINE - AWAITING COMMAND"
The system could suppress the fire in Corridor Gamma-7, but it would take 10 minutes to fully extinguish, and you'd still have the trapped Skitterer to deal with.
What does Dax do?

player: dax pulls himself together. he lays out the plan for chen.
he asks her to hit the ship-wide intercom and shout, as loud as she can, "THEY CAN'T SEE - DON'T MAKE A SOUND".
at the same time, dax uses the distraction to attempt to open the engineering bay door as quietly as possible. and then they both bolt for the 

claude: You take a deep breath, centering yourself. The plan is risky but solid.
"Alright. When you hit that intercom, those things are going to focus on the nearest sound source - you. Then I open the door and we run like hell."
Chen positions herself at the intercom, finger hovering over the broadcast button. "The lift is about 30 meters from the Engineering door. We'll have maybe five seconds before they recover from the surprise."
You move to the door controls, hand ready. The motion sensors show both Skitterers still lurking just outside.
"On three," you whisper. "One... two..."
"THREE!"
Chen slams the intercom button and bellows: "THEY CAN'T SEE - DON'T MAKE A SOUND!"
Her amplified voice echoes through the entire ship. On the sensors, you see both Skitterers immediately orient toward the nearest intercom speaker - on the far wall of the Hub.
Now!
Roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check (d20 + 4) to see if you can get the door open quietly while they're distracted.
The door mechanism is heavy and hasn't been maintained recently. This is the critical moment - if they hear it opening, you'll be fighting two Skitterers head-on with nowhere to run.
What do you roll?

player: Stealth check: 12 (rolled 

claude: Stealth check: 12 (Partial Success)
The door mechanism groans softly as you ease it open. One of the Skitterers' head snaps toward you, antennae twitching, but Chen's amplified voice is still echoing through the Hub's speakers, creating acoustic chaos.
"RUN!" you hiss.
You and Chen burst through the door into the Central Hub. The vast chamber is dimly lit by emergency power and the ghostly flicker of the holographic star map. The two Skitterers are about 15 meters away, near the far wall, but they're already turning toward you.
You sprint for the lift, Chen right beside you. Your multiple legs give you an advantage in speed, but she's running on pure adrenaline.
The lift doors are closed. You slam into the call button. The ancient mechanism begins to respond, doors starting to part with agonizing slowness.
Behind you, the distinctive click-clack-click of Skitterer legs on metal accelerates. They're charging.
"COME ON!" Chen shouts at the lift.
The doors are halfway open. You can squeeze through, but it's tight.
Roll a Dexterity saving throw (d20 + 4) to see if you both can dive through the closing lift doors before the Skitterers reach you!
The nearest Skitterer is raising its blade-arms, maybe 5 meters away and closing fast...
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 15 on a d20 +4 for 

claude: Dexterity saving throw: 19 (Success!)
You grab Chen with two arms while your other two push off the doorframe, launching both of you through the gap. You hit the lift floor hard, rolling as the doors continue their leisurely close.
A blade-arm slashes through the narrowing gap, missing Chen's leg by centimeters. The Skitterer slams into the doors, wedging its head partially through, mandibles snapping viciously.
Chen kicks it square in the face with her boot. "GET! BACK!"
The creature reels back just as the doors seal shut with a definitive clang.
You're both panting on the lift floor. Safe. For now.
"Deck... seven," Chen gasps, hitting the button for the Bridge level. "Officer's quarters... then Bridge."
The lift shudders and begins to rise. Through the thin walls, you can hear the frustrated shrieks of the Skitterers below, and the angry banging as they attack the lift doors.
Chen pulls herself up using the wall. "That was insane. But it worked. Your message was perfect - now the Captain and Dr. Yuen know the creatures hunt by sound."
The lift indicator shows: Deck 3... Deck 4... Deck 5...
"Dax," Chen says quietly. "The motion sensors showed something big in the Cargo Bay. Bigger than the Skitterers. What if it's between us and the Bridge?"
Deck 6... Deck 7.
DING
The doors begin to open onto the Officer's Quarters corridor. It's dark, lit only by emergency strips along the floor. The hallway stretches ahead, multiple doors on either side, leading toward a reinforced bulkhead marked "BRIDGE - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY."
The corridor appears empty. Too empty. No debris, no signs of struggle. Just pristine, waiting darkness.
What does Dax do?

player: dax's eyes glaze over, thinking about the doctor they've left so many floors down with those creatures. his failures left them wide open access to her from all angles.
"we have to save her"
dax bolts for the door and looks for a way to hack inside, or at least to communicate with the 

claude: The guilt hits you like a physical weight. Dr. Yuen is trapped, weak, possibly dying, and your escape route left her exposed to the creatures from multiple angles.
"We have to save her," you repeat, sprinting toward the Bridge bulkhead.
Chen runs after you. "Dax, wait—"
The Bridge door is massive, reinforced, with both electronic and manual locks. A security panel beside it glows amber - locked down. There's also an intercom grille specifically for Bridge communication.
You slam your palm on the intercom button. "Captain! This is Technical Specialist Dax Stargazer with Engineer Chen. We've restored main power. We need Bridge access NOW. Dr. Yuen is trapped in Medical with hostiles converging on her position!"
Silence.
Then, a ragged male voice crackles through: "...Stargazer? You're alive? Thank god. I'm Captain Morrison. I've... I've been monitoring the situation. The doctor's bio-signs are weakening."
"Then open this door!" you shout, already pulling out your multi-tool to attack the lock mechanism.
"I can't," Morrison's voice cracks. "Not yet. Listen to me very carefully. I'm injured. Badly. I sealed myself in here three days ago when those things overran the command deck. I've been using the last of my strength to maintain quarantine protocols, but..."
A pause. Heavy breathing.
"The cargo bay creature. It's not like the others. It's... it's growing. The sensors show it's tripled in size. If I open any bulkheads now, including this one, it could trigger the automated pathway systems. That thing could reach any part of the ship in minutes."
Chen grabs your arm. "Dax, he's right. If that thing is mobile—"
"I DON'T CARE!" You're already working on the panel, trying to find a bypass. "We're not leaving her to die!"
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to attempt to override the Bridge locks without triggering the automated systems Morrison warned about.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 8 on a d20, +3 for 

claude: Intelligence (Technology) check: 11 (Partial Success)
Your multi-tool sparks against the panel's inner workings. You're making progress, but these Bridge security protocols are military-grade. Sweat beads on your forehead as you work.
"Almost... almost..." You manage to bypass the first two security layers, but the third is encrypted with Captain-level authorization codes.
Morrison's voice crackles through: "Stargazer, stop! You're triggering proximity alerts. The cargo bay... oh god, it's moving. It knows someone's trying to breach secure areas."
On a small emergency display next to the door, you see a ship schematic light up. A massive red dot begins moving from the Cargo Bay, heading toward the lift shaft.
"It's climbing," Morrison whispers. "The thing is CLIMBING the lift shaft. It'll reach Deck 7 in minutes."
Chen pulls you back from the panel. "Dax, we need weapons or we need to run. NOW."
Morrison speaks again, faster now: "Listen! My override code is Zulu-Seven-Seven-Alpha-Nine. But if I open this door now, the automated systems will create a direct path from the lift to the Bridge. That thing will follow. You need to make a choice - get in here and seal yourselves with me, or lead it away from both Dr. Yuen and the Bridge."
From down the corridor behind you, you hear the lift shaft doors buckle. Something immense is forcing them apart from inside.
The Captain adds desperately: "There's an emergency weapons locker in Officer Quarters 3, halfway down the hall. Code is 7-3-5-5 - Rostova's code!"
A wet, tearing sound echoes from the lift. Something is squeezing through.
What does Dax do?

player: dax slams the door with all four fists in frustration. he forgets rank and process and demands that the captain do whatever he can to lockdown the medbay.
dax and chen use rostova's code to get into the officer quarters and look around primarily for anything that makes a lot of light or cold, and then for anything ballistic that might make a tremendous 

claude: The BANG of your four fists against reinforced steel echoes down the corridor.
"Captain, LOCK DOWN THE MEDICAL BAY NOW!" you roar, abandoning all protocol. "Whatever systems you have left - seal it!"
"I... I'm trying!" Morrison's voice crackles back. "Emergency bulkheads engaging... Medical Bay sealed. But Stargazer, her oxygen is limited now—"
You're already sprinting with Chen toward Officer Quarters 3. Behind you, something massive and wet slithers out of the lift shaft with a sound like meat being pulled apart.
Chen reaches the door first, punching in 7-3-5-5. The lock chirps green and you both pile inside.
The officer's quarters have been converted into an emergency armory. Rostova was prepared. Your eyes scan rapidly for anything useful:
COLD/LIGHT OPTIONS:

Emergency flare gun (6 magnesium flares - 2000°C burning temperature, blinding light)
Portable work lights (battery powered, extremely bright but not weaponized)
No additional cryo weapons

BALLISTIC/NOISE:

Riot shotgun (8 shells - thunderous noise, wide spread)
Two flashbang grenades (deafening blast, disorienting strobe)
Standard sidearm ammunition (30 rounds, fits your pistol)

Chen grabs the shotgun immediately. "This'll wake up the whole ship."
From the corridor, you hear a wet dragging sound getting closer. Whatever came from the cargo bay doesn't move like a Skitterer - it's massive, heavy, deliberate.
The Captain's voice crackles over the room's intercom: "Motion sensors show... oh god, it's huge. Twenty meters from your position and closing."
You have seconds to grab what you need and decide: Face this thing, or find another route?
What does Dax do?

player: dax grabs the flare gun but refocuses - he wants to lure this thing into the room they're in and set it all off. it might blow a hole into space, but as long as the door holds, he doesn't care. after picking the one item, he looks around for another way out of this room. he tells chen to plan to blow the 

claude: You grab the flare gun, already calculating the destruction it could cause in this confined space full of munitions. Chen's eyes widen as she understands your plan.
"You're insane," she breathes, but she's already grabbing flashbangs.
You scan the quarters desperately. Officer accommodations are usually connected - there! A maintenance hatch in the ceiling, probably leading to the environmental systems between decks.
The wet dragging is right outside the door now. The metal actually groans under something's weight.
"Chen, up!" You boost her toward the hatch with two arms while prying at it with the others. It's stuck, painted over—
The door to the quarters begins to buckle inward. Not breaking, but melting, the metal running like wax. Through the widening gaps, you see something that makes your brain rebel.
It WAS human once. Maybe. Now it's a writhing mass of flesh and absorbed materials - bits of metal, fabric, and other organic matter all fused into a nightmare roughly three meters tall. Eyes, dozens of them, blink randomly across its surface. A mouth opens where no mouth should be.
"THE COLD MAKES IT SLOW BUT IT DOESN'T STOP IT," Morrison screams over the intercom. "ROSTOVA'S LAST NOTES - IT'S STILL SPREADING, STILL GROWING—"
The maintenance hatch finally gives way. Chen hauls herself up.
Roll a Dexterity check (d20 + 4) to grab what you need and get through the hatch before this abomination enters the room!
What do you roll?

player: hell yeah, I rolled 18 on a d20 +4 for 

claude: Dexterity check: 22 (Critical Success!)
You move like liquid lightning. In one fluid motion, you grab two more flashbangs from the rack, toss them to arm strategically around the room, and leap upward. Your multiple arms make you a natural climber - you're through the hatch in seconds.
Just as you pull your legs up, the thing surges into the room below, its bulk filling the doorway. It "looks" up with those dozens of eyes, a wet gurgling sound emanating from multiple mouths.
"NOW!" you shout.
Chen doesn't hesitate. She pulls the pins on her flashbangs and drops them through the hatch. You add the flare gun's payload - all six flares fired in rapid succession down into that ammunition-filled room.
You both scramble through the crawlspace as fast as possible. Behind you:
BANG-BANG-BANG! The flashbangs detonate.
Then the flares hit the ammunition.
The explosion is catastrophic. The entire deck shudders. A wave of heat and pressure chases you through the crawlspace, but the reinforced structure holds. You hear shrieking metal, a terrible organic screaming, and then—
Sudden decompression. The blast must have breached the hull. Emergency klaxons wail as bulkheads automatically seal.
Morrison's voice, frantic: "Hull breach, Deck 7, Section C! Emergency containment... successful. The... the creature's bio-signature is gone. It's been spaced."
You and Chen drop through another hatch into a different corridor - you're past the sealed section, closer to the Bridge.
Chen is shaking. "We... we just blew a hole in the ship."
"But we're alive," you pant. "And that thing is gone."
The Bridge door is just ahead now, and Morrison is already entering his override code from the inside.
What does Dax do?

player: (holy shit, nice one.) dax is pleased they got rid of that thing, but laments not having been able to scan it. the information would have been very useful, in the immediate and for whenever they get out of this hell. when... they do...
"the doctor"
dax hurries towards the 

claude: The Bridge door hisses open, revealing a command center bathed in emergency lighting. Captain Morrison is slumped in the command chair, his uniform soaked with blood from a deep gash across his torso. His face is pale, drawn, but his eyes are sharp with determination.
"Stargazer, Chen," he rasps. "You did it. That... abomination is gone."
You rush forward but your mind is already elsewhere. "The doctor. We need to get to Dr. Yuen NOW."
Morrison weakly gestures to the main console. "Life support shows she's still alive, but barely. The Medical Bay is sealed, limited oxygen. Maybe... thirty minutes left." He coughs, blood speckling his lips. "The fire in Gamma-7 is dying down. Fire suppression finally kicked in. But those Skitterers..."
Chen is already at the weapons locker, loading fresh shells into the shotgun. "How many between us and Medical?"
Morrison pulls up the sensor display with a shaking hand. "Two in the Central Hub still. One trapped in the maintenance closet - that's your doing, Stargazer? And... three dormant in the Engineering vents."
You check your supplies: flare gun (empty), your sidearm (10 rounds), the cryo-foam canister (unused), multi-tool. Chen has the shotgun (8 shells) and the extra ammunition.
"The escape pods," Morrison continues weakly. "I can prep them for launch from here. But I can't leave this chair. Internal bleeding. I'm not... I'm not going to make it off this ship."
Chen looks stricken. "Captain, no—"
"That's an order, Engineer." His voice gains strength. "Save Dr. Yuen. Get to the pods. I'll keep the systems running as long as I can."
The timer is ticking. Dr. Yuen has less than 30 minutes of air.
What does Dax do?

player: dax wants to save them all. he does. but he caused the doctor's peril she's in. he knows he'll never sleep sound again unless he rights that wrong. it's almost strange how focused he is on her... as if something's tugging on his lost memories...
dax gives chen the medical scanner and asks if there's anything they can do for him, even... just temporarily...
meanwhile dax plans a route to the escape pods via the medbay. the lift they came in must be beyond repair, and the corridor leading to it is spaced (right? the emergency lockdown wouldn't have helped the melted door to the officers quarters?). they'll need another way 

claude: Chen takes the medical scanner and runs it over Morrison. The device confirms what you already suspected - massive internal hemorrhaging, multiple organ failure. He has maybe an hour at best.
"Captain," Chen says softly. "We could use the synth-flesh applicators, but—"
"Save them for someone who needs them," Morrison cuts her off. "I knew what I was doing when I stayed. Someone had to keep the quarantine protocols active." He manages a weak smile. "Besides, this chair has the best view in the ship."
You force yourself to focus on the route. The corridor you came through is definitely compromised - that explosion tore through Officer Quarters 3 and likely destroyed the lift shaft. You scan the Bridge's emergency schematics.
"There," you point. "Emergency access shaft behind the Bridge. It goes straight down to Deck 4, comes out near secondary cargo. From there, we can cut through to reach the Medical Bay's back entrance - the one that leads to the emergency ward."
Morrison nods. "Smart. That route bypasses the Central Hub entirely. But..." he pulls up more sensors, "you'll pass right by the main cargo hold. Where that thing came from. There might be... residue. Or worse."
Chen loads her shotgun. "Twenty-five minutes of air left for Dr. Yuen."
Something tugs at your mind when you think of her. A flash of... something. A memory just out of reach. White coat. Gentle hands checking the strange energy signature behind your temple. A soft voice saying, "Don't worry, Dax. You're going to be fine. I promise."
You shake your head. Focus.
Morrison starts typing commands. "I'm opening the emergency shaft and plotting your route. The escape pods will be primed and ready. Bay 3 is closest to Medical - I'll make sure it stays clear."
The captain looks at you both. "Whatever happens, don't come back for me. That's an order."
Behind the main command console, a panel slides open revealing a narrow vertical shaft with ladder rungs.
What does Dax do?

player: dax takes an awkward moment to apologize... a weak salute, a thank you... and heads for the 

claude: You turn to Morrison and offer an awkward, four-armed salute - not quite military regulation, but heartfelt. "Thank you, Captain. For... for holding the line."
Morrison returns it weakly. "Get our people home, Stargazer."
You and Chen descend into the emergency shaft. The rungs are cold under your hands, and you move quickly but carefully in the darkness. Chen follows above you, the shotgun slung across her back.
Deck 6... Deck 5... Deck 4.
The shaft opens into a utility corridor. Immediately, the smell hits you - organic, wrong, like rotting fruit mixed with ozone. The walls here have a thin film of something translucent and sticky.
"Residue," Chen whispers. "From that thing."
You move quickly, trying not to think about what you're walking through. The main cargo hold doors are sealed, but you can see through the reinforced windows - the entire bay is coated in the same organic film, with strange, pod-like growths on the walls. They pulse faintly.
"Keep moving," you mutter, that strange pull toward Medical Bay getting stronger.
Another flash of memory: Dr. Yuen's voice, clearer now. "The energy signature in your temporal lobe, Dax. It's not harmful, but it's... unusual. Like an echo of something. When you're ready, come find me. We'll figure it out together."
Twenty minutes of air left.
You reach the emergency ward entrance. Your scanner (in Chen's hands) shows Dr. Yuen's life signs are weak but stable, located in the main treatment room. The trapped Skitterer is in the maintenance closet about 30 meters away, still contained.
The ward door is sealed but responds to your multi-tool. As it hisses open, stale air rushes out.
What does Dax do?

player: dax tries to joke about not thinking too much about what all that was they just walked through, but the gravity of the situation makes it sound like genuine worry.
he asks chen to help him look around the emergency ward for anything that might help the 

claude: "Let's just... not think about the cargo bay," you attempt weakly, but your voice betrays genuine concern. "Whatever was growing in there..."
Chen gives you a grim look. "Yeah. Let's focus on Dr. Yuen."
The emergency ward is a smaller medical facility, separate from the main Med Bay you woke up in. It's clearly been ransacked - supplies scattered, cabinets torn open. Someone was looking for something desperately.
You and Chen quickly search through the chaos:
Chen finds:

Oxygen mask with a portable 10-minute emergency tank
Two more stim injectors (adrenaline-based)
Surgical laser (battery nearly dead)

You discover:

IV fluid bags (still sealed)
Emergency thermal blanket
A medical log pad, still powered

The log pad's last entry is from Dr. Yuen, dated two days ago:
"Barricaded in Treatment Room 2. The infections are spreading among the survivors I'm treating. Not from wounds - from exposure to the organic matter in the cargo. It changes people. Morrison was right to maintain quarantine. If anyone reads this, DO NOT let the infected reach the escape pods."
Chen's face pales. "Infected survivors? But the sensors only show Dr. Yuen..."
Fifteen minutes of oxygen left.
From deeper in the ward, you hear a faint tapping. Rhythmic. Deliberate. Like someone knocking on glass.
Treatment Room 2 is just ahead, its observation window dark.
What does Dax do?

player: infected... escape pods... the cargo bay...
"scan us" dax says, intentionally trying to ignore the tapping, "and pick up everything you can. i'll do the same. we'll only need it for the doctor, scoop up whatever you can take into the next room. i'll focus on getting us in"
dax begins breaking his way into the main med 

claude: Chen quickly runs the scanner over both of you while you work on the door.
"We're clean," she reports, relief evident in her voice. "No contamination detected." She starts gathering supplies - oxygen tanks, IV bags, anything portable.
You focus on the Med Bay door. It's magnetically sealed from the emergency quarantine. Your multi-tool's plasma torch still has charge, and you start cutting through the lock mechanism.
The tapping from Treatment Room 2 gets more insistent. You don't look. Can't look. Not yet.
The lock gives way with a sharp crack. The door to the main Med Bay hisses open, and you're back where this nightmare started. The cryo-pod you woke from stands open like a mouth. The terminal you first accessed flickers weakly. And there, in the corner near the surgical suite, is Dr. Yuen.
She's alive but unconscious, slumped against the wall. An oxygen mask covers her face, connected to a depleted tank. Her medical coat is stained with blood - not all of it hers. Around her are three bodies, other crew members who didn't make it.
Chen rushes over with the emergency oxygen tank, swapping it quickly. "Ten minutes of air, then we move."
Dr. Yuen's eyes flutter open as the fresh oxygen hits. She focuses on you, and despite everything, manages a weak smile.
"Dax... knew you'd come back. The signature... behind your temple... it's a memory lock. You asked me to... to put it there. Before the mission. You knew something... something about the cargo..."
The tapping from the emergency ward has turned into pounding.
Roll a Medicine check (d20 + 1) to stabilize Dr. Yuen enough to move her to the escape pods.
What do you roll?

player: shit, I rolled 6 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Medicine check: 7 (Failure)
You try to help Dr. Yuen sit up, but she cries out in pain. Your hands come away bloody - there's a deep laceration along her ribs you hadn't seen, poorly bandaged and reopened.
"Stop, stop—" she gasps. "Broken ribs too. From when the ship lurched."
Chen curses. "She can't move like this. We need to properly stabilize her or she'll bleed out before we reach the pods."
The pounding from the emergency ward intensifies. Glass cracks.
Dr. Yuen grabs your arm with surprising strength. "Dax, listen. The memory lock—you were investigating the Captain's cargo manifest. You found discrepancies. The artifacts weren't from a derelict. They were... purchased. Black market. Morrison didn't know what he was buying."
Her eyes are urgent, desperate. "The code is your employee ID backwards. 5-5-3-7. It'll unlock the memories. But Dax, you might not—"
CRASH.
The observation window in the emergency ward shatters. Through the doorway, you see shapes moving. Not Skitterers. People. But wrong. Their movements are jerky, unnatural. The infection Dr. Yuen mentioned.
"We need to move NOW," Chen says, trying to lift Dr. Yuen despite her injuries.
You have to decide:

Try to carry Dr. Yuen despite her injuries (risking further damage)
Stay and defend while properly treating her wounds
The memory unlock code is right there (5-5-3-7)... but is now the time?

Eight minutes of oxygen left.
What does Dax do?

player: dax tells chen to leave the medical equipment with him and fend off the infected as best as she can while he treats the doctor. "whatever you do, do not let them near you. do not get infected. we're getting out of here, all three of 

claude: Chen doesn't hesitate. She chambers a shell in the shotgun. "On it. Just save her!"
She moves to the doorway between the main Med Bay and the emergency ward. The first infected stumbles through - it was once a crew member, still wearing a science division uniform, but fungal growths pulse along their neck and arms. Their eyes are milky, unfocused.
BOOM! Chen's shotgun roars. The infected flies backward.
"They're still coming!" Chen shouts, chambering another round.
You turn to Dr. Yuen, forcing yourself to focus. You have proper medical supplies now. You need to clean and seal that laceration, stabilize her ribs, and get her mobile.
You grab the surgical laser (praying its battery holds), the remaining synth-flesh applicators, and get to work. Your four hands let you work efficiently - one pair cleaning the wound, the other preparing supplies.
"This is going to hurt," you warn Dr. Yuen.
"Do it," she gasps.
Roll another Medicine check (d20 + 1), but this time with advantage (roll twice, take the higher) because you have proper supplies and Chen is buying you time.
BOOM! Another shotgun blast. "Six shells left!" Chen calls out. "Whatever you're doing, do it fast! There's at least four more coming!"
The infected are moaning now, a low, harmonious sound that makes your skin crawl.
What do you roll? (Remember, roll 2d20 and take the higher result, then add 1)

player: I rolled 14 on a d20, +1 for 

claude: Medicine check: 15 (Success!)
Your hands work with the precision of someone who fixes delicate machinery. The surgical laser sputters but holds - you quickly cauterize the worst bleeding. The synth-flesh applicator seals the wound with a thick, protective layer. You wrap her ribs with the emergency bandages, tight enough to support but not restrict breathing.
Dr. Yuen gasps as the pain medications from the med kit kick in. Color returns to her face.
BOOM! "Five shells!" Chen shouts. An infected crashes into the doorframe, reaching for her with fingers that end in fungal blooms. She smashes it back with the butt of the shotgun.
"I can move," Dr. Yuen says, gripping your arm. "Not fast, but I can move."
You help her stand, supporting her weight. She's shaky but mobile.
"Chen, we're going!" you call out.
"About time!" Chen fires another round - BOOM! "Four shells! The path to the escape pods?"
Dr. Yuen points weakly. "Back exit. Through the recovery ward. It connects to Escape Bay 3."
But then she grabs your arm tighter. "Dax, before we go - the memory lock. You need to know. The cargo... Morrison was tricked. The seller knew what they were selling. This was intentional. Someone wanted these things loose on a ship."
The infected are pushing through faster than Chen can stop them. One gets past her guard, lurching toward you with arms outstretched, mouth opening to reveal fungal growths inside.
Six minutes of oxygen remaining.
What does Dax do?

player: dax shoots two rounds at the infected lunging for him, emptying it. he doesn't have time to reload - he's not even sure how. he regrets not having taken weapons specialization during his tech training. he never thought he'd need to, the meatheads always knew their guns better than him anyway.
he prepares the cryo-foam as the doctor's words linger. the urgency she's sharing this information at such a critical time... he has to know. he punches in the 

claude: BANG! BANG!
Your shots hit center mass. The infected stumbles backward, dark fluid leaking from the wounds, but it doesn't stop. It's still coming, just slower.
"They don't drop like normal!" Chen shouts, blasting another one. "Three shells!"
You holster your empty sidearm and grip the cryo-foam canister, but as you do, your other hand moves almost involuntarily to the keypad on your belt. Dr. Yuen's urgency, the desperation in her voice...
You punch in 5-5-3-7.
The effect is immediate and overwhelming.
MEMORY RESTORED:
You're in the cargo bay three weeks ago, scanner in hand. The "artifacts" are biological pods, clearly engineered. Your scan results show manufacturer tags - Weyland Biosystems, a black market weapons dealer.
You confront Morrison in private. He's shocked, horrified. "I thought they were archaeological samples! The seller said—"
"Captain, we need to jettison these NOW."
"We can't. Company paid too much. They'd court martial me."
You argue. Then you go to Dr. Yuen. Together you plan to disable them, make them 'accidentally' unusable. But you need to hide your knowledge first, in case something goes wrong. The memory lock was your insurance policy...
The flashback ends. You're back in the present. An infected is two meters away.
"DAX!" Chen screams.
You raise the cryo-foam canister and spray. The super-cooled foam engulfs the infected, flash-freezing the fungal growths. It stops mid-lunge, frozen solid.
"The cold!" Dr. Yuen gasps. "It kills the infection! The cryo-foam—"
But you only have one canister, already half-empty. More infected are coming.
Five minutes of oxygen left.
What does Dax do?

player: "we shoot it" dax says, "and run like hell"
dax throws the cryo-foam canister at the infected and shouts to chen, "BLAST IT!"
he uses his arms to help the doctor move quicker as he heads for the route to the escape pods, making sure chen is close with 

claude: You hurl the cryo-foam canister into the cluster of infected pushing through the doorway.
"BLAST IT!"
Chen doesn't need to be told twice. BOOM!
The canister explodes in a cloud of super-cooled foam and shrapnel. The infected caught in the blast freeze solid, their fungal growths crystallizing and shattering. The doorway is blocked by frozen bodies.
"Move! MOVE!"
You support Dr. Yuen with two arms while keeping your other two free for balance. Chen covers your retreat, walking backward with the shotgun ready. Two shells left.
You burst through the recovery ward - empty beds, dark monitors. The escape pod bay door is ahead, marked with green emergency lighting. You can hear the pods' ready signals beeping.
Behind you, crashing sounds. The frozen infected are being pushed aside by more of them.
You reach Escape Bay 3. Three pods are prepped and humming. Through the small windows, you can see stars.
"Get her in!" Chen shouts, helping you lift Dr. Yuen into the nearest pod.
As you strap the doctor in, she grabs your hand. "Dax... Weyland Biosystems. Remember that name. They did this deliberately. Someone needs to know."
Morrison's voice crackles over the intercom, weaker now: "All pods ready for launch. I'm... I'm initiating emergency separation in 60 seconds. Get in and seal up."
Chen is already climbing into the second pod. "Dax, come on!"
But you hear something. From the vents above. Clicking.
The Skitterers. They've found you.
What does Dax do?

player: ever the macguyver, dax takes the clip of 8 rounds for his sidearm and jury rigs the multitool to set them off 10 seconds before escape pod release. he climbs into a pod and seals it shut. "CAPTIAN", he shouts, "SEND US ALL TO <place>. AND... THANK YOU" (where <place> is whatever the nearest planet's largest friendly settlement is, that he'd know 

claude: You grab the spare ammunition clip and your multi-tool, working with desperate efficiency. The plasma torch function should generate enough heat to cook off the rounds when triggered. You wedge the clip against the bay door mechanism and set the sonic wrench to a delayed overload pulse - in 10 seconds it'll create enough vibration and heat to detonate the ammunition.
You dive into the third pod, slamming the hatch. Through the small window, you can see a Skitterer dropping from the vent just as your improvised bomb starts humming.
"CAPTAIN!" you shout into the pod's comm. "SEND US ALL TO TITAN STATION. AND... THANK YOU!"
Morrison's voice, barely a whisper now: "Titan Station. Confirmed. It's been... an honor, Stargazer. Tell them... tell them what happened here."
The multi-tool sparks. The ammunition detonates in a series of sharp cracks, sending the Skitterer reeling back.
"Emergency launch in 3... 2... 1..."
The pods fire with tremendous force, shooting you out into the void. Through your window, you watch the U.E.S. Wanderer shrink behind you. Small explosions ripple along its hull - the infected, the Skitterers, all contained within a dying ship.
In the pod's gentle emergency lighting, you can see Chen in pod 2, and Dr. Yuen in pod 1, both safely away. The vast black of space surrounds you, but for the first time in days, you feel genuinely safe.
The pod's nav computer chirps: "Course set: Titan Station. Arrival in 18 hours. Entering auto-sleep mode to preserve life support."
As the sedatives kick in, your last thought is clear: Weyland Biosystems. Someone will answer for this.
[END OF CHAPTER 1: THE WANDERER]

Would you like to continue with Dax's story on Titan Station, or shall we leave our hero here, safely drifting toward answers and, perhaps, revenge?

player: hell no, we carry on!
let's pause a sec though and update the artifact. we're gonna want a summary of things learned, things that happened. updated inventory - let's get a shared inventory going actually, for chen and yuen as well (although i don't think we know what yuen has on her yet). 
update the currency for something more apt, space-wise. also we seem to do a lot of medical, so let's get a medical quick action added (and maybe one more? something else we did a

The mystery of what Dr. Yuen has with her
The full story summary in the quest log


CHAPTER 2: TITAN STATION
18 hours later...
The escape pod's emergency lights flicker on as the sedatives wear off. Through the small porthole, you see it: Titan Station, a massive cylindrical structure rotating slowly against Saturn's pale gold backdrop. It's a trade hub, neutral territory, corporate and government interests all mixing in an uneasy dance.
Your pod shudders as docking clamps engage. A tinny automated voice crackles: "Welcome to Titan Station. Please remain seated for security scanning."
A red beam sweeps through the pod. "Bioscan complete. No contamination detected. Survivor of U.E.S. Wanderer, please proceed to Quarantine Bay 7 for processing."
The hatch hisses open. You stumble out onto a stark white docking platform. Chen is already there, helping Dr. Yuen who looks pale but stable. Around you, a dozen security officers in full environmental suits point rifles your way.
"Easy," says a voice through an external speaker. "Standard quarantine protocol. We picked up your distress beacon. The Wanderer is listed as... lost with all hands?"
Before you can answer, Dr. Yuen speaks up: "Three survivors. The ship suffered catastrophic breach. We need to speak to Station Administrator immediately. This was not an accident."
What does Dax do?

player: wait one sec, pause until i say restart, just wanna work some things out
1. good ask at the end of ch1 - i don't really see this 'ending' unless dax fails so hard he kicks the bucket. it is a solo campaign so once he's dead, it's over. i think? i dunno, maybe let's leave it open to perhaps jumping into another character's shoes (e.g. if dax had stayed back on the ship in ch1, i take over chen instead for ch2).
2. along those lines, i don't mind long periods without 'action'. we had a very explosive start, which was awesome, but i also like diplomacy and politics and that kind of on-world drama too. i'm a big fan of like mass effect and the expanse novels and such (please don't start including biotics and beltalowda now lol). let's go full space opera.
3. technical question - i just realized this conversation's gonna hit a max limit, isn't it? can you bake something into the save function that's like a CLAUDE.md note to yourself for continuing it on in a new conversation? i think you can look back at previous ones, right? so you could see this one (and the artifact?) and recreate + carry 

claude: Perfect pause points! Let me address each:
1. Death & Character Switching: Absolutely! If Dax dies, we could definitely continue with Chen or Dr. Yuen's perspective. Or even introduce a new character investigating what happened. The story continues even if Dax doesn't. Makes the stakes real without ending everything.
2. Space Opera Vibes: Love it! Politics, corporate espionage, station intrigue, investigation, tense negotiations - all fantastic. We can have long stretches of detective work, relationship building, and political maneuvering. Think more DS9 than just Alien. The Weyland conspiracy is perfect for this.
3. Continuation System: Smart thinking! Let me add a save note function:D&D Solo Campaign CompanionInteractive artifact ∙ Version 31 Perfect! I've added a "Campaign Notes" section that includes:

A template for continuation notes
Current story state
Key plot points
GM style preferences

When you save the game, this will all be included. If we hit the conversation limit, you can paste this into a new conversation and I'll have everything I need to continue seamlessly. I can also search back to this conversation to see the full artifact and history.
The save function now captures both the mechanical game state AND the narrative context, so we could pick up exactly where we left off.
Ready to restart whenever you are! Dax is standing on that platform with rifles pointed at him, about to navigate the political minefield of Titan Station...

claude: Got it - multi-tool is gone, sacrificed for that explosive exit!

CHAPTER 2: TITAN STATION
The security officers keep their weapons trained on you. The lead officer's voice crackles through their suit speaker again, more insistent: "Three survivors? Our scans showed... that's impossible. The Wanderer's emergency beacon indicated total atmospheric breach over 72 hours ago."
Dr. Yuen sways slightly, and Chen steadies her. "We need medical attention, not an interrogation," Chen snaps. "The doctor's injured."
The lead officer hesitates, then gestures to their team. "Lower weapons. But maintain quarantine protocol." They turn back to you. "I'm Lieutenant Commander Reeves, Titan Security. You'll be escorted to Quarantine Medical for full decontamination and debriefing. Any weapons must be surrendered now."
Chen reluctantly hands over the shotgun with its two remaining shells. You have nothing left to give - your sidearm is empty, just dead weight.
As you're escorted through stark white corridors, you notice Titan Station is nothing like the Wanderer. Every surface is pristine, corporate logos everywhere - Sakura Industries, Kepler Mining Consortium, and there, making your blood run cold - a small Weyland Biosystems office marker.
Dr. Yuen notices your reaction and grabs your arm, whispering: "Not here. Not yet."
The quarantine medical bay is a hive of activity. You're separated - different examination rooms. A medtech in a hazmat suit runs scanner after scanner over you. "Remarkable," they mutter. "No contamination, but these stress markers... what happened out there?"
Through the observation window, you can see Chen in another room, arguing with her examiner. Dr. Yuen is on a medical bed, proper doctors treating her injuries.
The door hisses open. A woman enters - mid-40s, sharp suit, no hazmat gear. Corporate authority radiates from her.
"Mr. Stargazer. I'm Director Sarah Holbrook, Titan Station Administration. I understand you have quite a story to tell. And accusations to make about one of our corporate tenants?" She sits across from you, placing a tablet on the table. "Please. Start from the beginning."
What does Dax do?

player: dax ignores the director and asks a nearby doctor about chen and yuen's 

claude: You turn away from Director Holbrook entirely, focusing on the medtech still in the room running scans.
"My crew," you say firmly. "Chen and Dr. Yuen. What's their status?"
The medtech glances nervously at the Director, who raises an eyebrow but nods permission.
"The engineer - Chen - is uninjured. Elevated stress hormones, mild dehydration, but physically fine. She's... uh... being quite vocal about wanting to rejoin you." Through the window, you can see Chen gesturing emphatically at her examiner.
"Dr. Yuen is stable," the medtech continues. "Three cracked ribs, deep tissue laceration, significant blood loss - but she'll recover. We're treating her with regenerative gel. She'll need at least 48 hours of observation."
Director Holbrook clears her throat. "Your concern for your crew is admirable, Mr. Stargazer. But we have protocols. Three survivors from a ship that should have been completely vented to space? Biological hazard warnings in your emergency beacon? And now accusations against Weyland Biosystems?"
She leans forward. "I need answers. The station's safety depends on it. Twenty thousand souls live here. So I'll ask again - what happened on the Wanderer?"
The director's tablet sits between you, recording everything. In the corner of your vision, you notice the small Weyland Biosystems logo on one of the medical supply cabinets.
What does Dax do?

player: dax explains what happened. he gives incredible detail about the creatures, how they were fought off in various situations. same with the infected, and the giant one that seemed to be made of people. he describes the cargo hold, their escape. the bravery of their captain.
at no point, though, does he mention weyland through this. very 

claude: You speak for nearly twenty minutes, your voice steady and clinical. You describe the Skitterers - their blindness, their sensitivity to sound, the clicking of their chitin on metal. You detail their vulnerability to heat and how their webs burn but turn brittle when frozen.
Director Holbrook's expression shifts from skepticism to concern as you describe the infected crew members, the fungal growths, their immunity to conventional weapons. Her stylus stops moving when you describe the amalgamation - the thing that had absorbed people and materials into itself, growing, spreading.
"We improvised weapons from dead datapads," you explain, your four hands demonstrating the precise angle needed to puncture the batteries. "The thermal discharge was our only effective defense against the Skitterers."
You describe Morrison's final stand, maintaining quarantine protocols even as he bled out in the captain's chair. The medtech has stopped pretending to work, listening with rapt horror.
"The cargo bay," you continue, "was covered in organic residue. Pulsing growths on the walls. We believe that's where the contamination originated - some kind of artifact or sample that breached containment."
Holbrook's eyes narrow slightly. "Artifacts? What kind of artifacts?"
You shrug with all four shoulders. "Unknown. The captain's logs might have that information, but they went down with the ship. Whatever it was, it wasn't properly catalogued or secured."
The Director exchanges a glance with someone behind the one-way observation glass. "Mr. Stargazer, you're saying this was a containment breach? An accident?"
"I'm saying twenty-three people are dead," you reply evenly. "And three of us barely escaped. The cause is for investigators to determine."
She studies you carefully. "Indeed. You'll be interested to know that Weyland Biosystems has already filed an insurance claim for lost cargo aboard the Wanderer. They're citing improper handling by the crew as the cause."
Your mandibles twitch - a Vexian tell that humans rarely recognize. But you keep your voice neutral. "Is that so?"
What does Dax do?

player: mmm let's roll something for dax to stay 

claude: You feel your mandibles starting to twitch more visibly - a dead giveaway of your agitation to anyone who knows Vexian body language. Weyland is already spinning the narrative, blaming the dead crew for their own murders.
Roll a Wisdom saving throw (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to maintain your composure and not reveal that you know more than you're saying.
This is crucial - if you lose control now, you might tip your hand too early. The Director is watching you carefully, and whoever is behind that observation glass is certainly recording everything.
What do you roll?

player: whew, I rolled 17 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Wisdom saving throw: 18 (Success!)
You take a slow breath through your spiracles, a 

claude: ative technique from your homeworld. Your mandibles still, your four hands rest calmly on the table. When you speak, your voice is perfectly level.
"Insurance claims already? The crew isn't even cold yet." You let just the right amount of disgust creep in - what any survivor would feel. "I suppose corporate efficiency doesn't pause for grief."
Director Holbrook watches you intently. "You were the ship's Tech-Scout, correct? You'd have access to cargo manifests, shipping records..."
"I had access to a lot of systems," you reply carefully. "My job was maintaining equipment, not questioning cargo. Captain Morrison handled acquisitions."
"And Morrison is conveniently dead."
The temperature in the room seems to drop. Chen's voice carries through the wall - she's shouting now, though you can't make out words.
"Captain Morrison died a hero," you say, letting real emotion color your voice. "He stayed at his post to maintain quarantine. He saved this station from infection. Convenience had nothing to do with it."
Holbrook taps her stylus against the tablet. "Mr. Stargazer, I'm going to be frank. Weyland Biosystems has significant interests on this station. They employ 300 people here. They're demanding we declare this an act of crew negligence so they can collect their insurance. But your story..." she pauses, "suggests something else."
She leans back. "What I need is proof. Documentation. Recordings. Something more than the testimony of traumatized survivors."
Behind her, the door opens. A young man in a Weyland Biosystems uniform enters, datapad in hand. "Director, Mr. Kellerman wants to know if the survivors are ready for corporate debriefing."
Your mandibles definitely twitch at that.
What does Dax do?

player: (who is dax and co.'s employer? like the owner of the ship/the captain's 

claude: (Good question! Let me establish this - it's important for the political dynamics)
The U.E.S. Wanderer was operated by United 

claude: ions Syndicate - a mid-tier shipping and exploration company that handles cargo runs and survey missions in the outer systems. Not a huge corporation, but respectable. They have a small office here on Titan Station, probably just two or three people.
Captain Morrison reported to U.E.S. management, who would have contracted with Weyland for the "artifact" transport. U.E.S. would be liable if crew negligence is proven - their insurance would have to pay out Weyland's claim.

Director Holbrook notices your reaction to the Weyland representative. "Mr. Kellerman can wait," she says coolly. "These survivors are still in medical quarantine."
The young Weyland employee shifts uncomfortably. "Sir, Mr. Kellerman insisted—"
"And I'm insisting he wait." Her tone could freeze helium. "Out."
He retreats. Holbrook turns back to you.
"United 

claude: ions Syndicate has already been notified of the loss. They're sending a representative, but it'll be three days before they arrive. In the meantime, Weyland is pushing hard for immediate depositions. They want this wrapped up quickly."
She stands. "You and your crewmates will be kept in protective custody - for your safety and continued medical observation, of course. You'll have quarters in Section C. Comfortable, but monitored."
The way she says 'protective' makes it clear - you're not prisoners, but you're not exactly free either.
"One more thing, Mr. Stargazer. That memory gap you mentioned in your initial medical scan - the one from three weeks before the incident - Weyland's legal team will definitely use that against your testimony."
She heads for the door, then pauses. "If there were proof of what really happened... now would be the time to remember where it might be."
What does Dax do?

player: dax is torn. he's not the most perceptive, but he's smart enough to see that however much influence weyland might have galactically/universally (whatever their reach is), it's clear who the boss is on titan. maybe those 300 employees don't count for much in the grand scheme of things? maybe the director's not actually a fan of weyland either... he regrets acting quite so cold towards her; though she's clearly no friend, she's in between them and weyland right now, which is certainly not a foe. he needs to know more about her, her office, her peers, before he can trust.it's still too early to tip his hand. and what evidence? dax's medical scanner has logs on the creatures, but won't help accusations of crew malpractice. martinez's data log though... dax hopes chen's keeping it tight to her chest. dax thanks the director for their protection and their medical aid, and asks if they could arrange for him to speak with titan's UES 

claude: Director Holbrook pauses at the door, considering your request. "The U.E.S. representative on-station is... not what you'd expect from a company that just lost a ship and crew. But yes, I can arrange that."
She turns back, studying you with calculating eyes. "Jonathan Park. He runs the U.E.S. office here - though 'office' is generous. It's mostly a mail drop and comms relay. He'll be notified you're alive within the hour."
The medtech clears their throat. "Director, the quarantine period?"
"48 hours minimum," Holbrook confirms. "Mr. Stargazer, you'll have comm access from your quarters, but all communications will be monitored - standard quarantine protocol, you understand. Can't risk contamination spreading through the station's networks."
She means Weyland will be listening too, you realize.
"Your personal effects will be returned after decontamination," she continues. "Though I understand there isn't much. A dead scanner, an empty weapon. Nothing else?"
It's a probe, careful but clear. She's asking if you have evidence hidden somewhere.
Through the observation window, you see Chen being escorted out, flanked by two security officers. She catches your eye through the glass and taps her chest pocket twice - a subtle gesture, but clear. Martinez's data log is still with her, still hidden.
"Just what you see," you answer Holbrook. "We left with what we could carry."
"Indeed." She keys something into her tablet. "Mr. Park will contact you once you're settled. Fair warning - he's been on-station for three years without a single incident. This situation is... beyond his usual scope."
Translation: he's a bureaucrat, not equipped for corporate warfare against Weyland.
The door hisses open again. "Medical will finish your examination. Welcome to Titan Station, Mr. Stargazer. Try not to cause the kind of trouble that follows survival stories."
What does Dax do?

player: (by the way, when i ask a clarifying question ooc like this, please don't move the story along. i'm just looking for a clarification so i can make a good decision. with that said, where is dax and co. headed right now? a quarrantine holding was 

claude: (Got it - I'll keep things frozen until you decide what to do. Here's the clarification:)
Current situation:

You're still in the medical examination room with the medtech
Director Holbrook just left
Chen has been escorted out by security (you saw her through the window)
Dr. Yuen is still being treated in another room

Where you're headed:

After medical finishes examining you, you'll be taken to "quarters in Section C"
These are quarantine quarters - comfortable but monitored rooms where you'll spend the mandatory 48-hour observation period
You'll have comm access but all communications will be monitored
It's "protective custody" - not quite prison, but you can't leave freely

The three of you will likely have separate quarters but in the same section. Think of it like a medical isolation ward crossed with a decent hotel - private rooms, basic amenities, but locked doors and cameras everywhere.

player: as dax leaves and is escorted to the section C quarters, he examines his surroundings extremely carefully and intently to gauge exactly how much influence weyland has on this 

claude: (Understood - no story progression on OOC questions. Let me describe what Dax observes:)
The medtech finishes their scans and two security officers arrive to escort you. As you walk through Titan Station's corridors, your trained eye catalogues everything:
Corporate Presence Visible:

Wall displays cycle through advertisements - about 1 in 5 are Weyland Biosystems (biomedical supplies, "frontier development solutions," mining equipment)
Directory signs list companies: Sakura Industries seems biggest (they have a whole section), Kepler Mining Consortium is prominent, Weyland has a modest office suite on Level 7
Security uniforms have Titan Station patches, not corporate logos - station security, not private
Maintenance crews wear station colors too

Power Dynamics You Notice:

The security officers escort you past a Weyland office branch; the corporate workers barely glance up - they don't seem to have special authority
A Sakura Industries exec argues with station security at a checkpoint and loses, having to submit to scanning
Port workers loading cargo wear different company logos but all answer to station dock authorities
Emergency protocols posted everywhere are signed by "Titan Station Authority" not any corporation

The Layout:

Section C (quarantine) is in the station's inner ring - prime real estate, suggesting the station takes quarantine seriously
Weyland's offices are mid-ring, not the prestigious outer ring with views of Saturn
The Administrator's offices you passed earlier were central, upper level - the seat of real power

Your Assessment:
Weyland has money and influence here, but they're one of several corporate players, not the boss. The station itself maintains independence. Director Holbrook runs things, and she doesn't seem to be in anyone's pocket - yet.
The quarters door looms ahead.
What does Dax do?

player: (prolly should have been a wisdom roll lol but i appreciate it)dax is relieved to see that titan station is not one that has been overridden with corporate influence - *yet. *he notes the location of the weyland offices as he passes, sure that he'll be returning there in one capacity or another before this is over.
he continues on his escort to 

claude: (Yeah, a Wisdom/Perception roll would've been appropriate there - good catch!)
The security officers lead you into Section C. The corridor here is different from the industrial grey of the docking area - warmer lighting, actual color on the walls (a calming blue-green), even some plants in wall-mounted containers. It's designed to be less threatening, but the cameras in every corner and the mag-locked doors remind you what this really is.
"Room C-7," one officer says, keying open a door. "Your personal effects will be delivered after decontamination. Food service is automated - use the panel. Comms are on the desk. Any medical emergency, hit the red button."
The room is... nice, actually. A bed sized for various species (it'll accommodate your Vexian frame), a small workspace with a communications terminal, a viewport showing Saturn's rings in the distance. There's even a beverage dispenser - coffee, tea, various other options.
"Your crewmates are in C-5 and C-9," the officer adds. "No physical contact during quarantine, but you can use internal comms. Quarantine lifts in 48 hours assuming no contamination signs."
They leave, and the door seals with a soft hiss. You're alone for the first time in days.
The comms terminal is already blinking with a message indicator. The screen shows:

1 Message from J.PARK (United 

claude: ions Syndicate)
System Notice: All communications monitored per Quarantine Protocol 7

What does Dax do?

player: (ooc pause: can you gimme some world lore? it seems we're in the milky way, very advanced, with alien settlers. just as much as dax would know as a regular citizen(?), though also as one of such settlers. but he's no history buff or 

claude: (OOC World Lore - what Dax knows as a regular spacer:)
The Setting:

The year is 2387, humanity reached the stars about 150 years ago
Still in the Milky Way - no extragalactic travel yet
FTL exists but it's expensive and takes time (days/weeks between systems)
Saturn's moons like Titan are "core worlds" now - safe, established, civilized
The real frontier is beyond the outer planets

Alien Contact:

First Contact happened 87 years ago with the Vexians (your people)
Vexians were already spacefaring when humans met them
About a dozen known sapient species now, mostly peaceful trade relations
No "Federation" - just treaties, trade agreements, and neutral stations like Titan
Some species are older/more advanced, but no one has overwhelming tech superiority

Your People (Vexians):

Come from a low-gravity world with lots of caves/underground cities
Four arms evolved for climbing/navigating complex 3D environments
Naturally good with tech and spatial reasoning
Maybe 2-3% of station population - not rare but not common
Humans still sometimes stare but it's mostly polite curiosity now

Corporate/Political Structure:

Earth has a unified government (United Earth) but it's weak past Mars
Corporations run most things beyond the inner planets
Stations like Titan are "neutral ground" - independent but everyone trades there
Companies like Weyland are megacorps but not quite cyberpunk-level omnipotent
United 

claude: ions Syndicate is small - maybe 50 ships total

That's the basics Dax would know without being a scholar. Ready to continue?

player: (sick ty)dax first pings c-5 and c-9 to see if either of his crewmates are back 

claude: You key in C-5 first. The screen shows "CHEN, M. - CONNECTED"
Chen's face appears immediately, like she was waiting by the terminal. "Dax! Finally! They've had me in this box for twenty minutes already. You okay? What did the Director ask you?"
Before you can answer, she leans closer to the camera and mouths silently: "Still have it." She taps her chest - Martinez's data log.
You toggle to C-9. "YUEN, S. - NO RESPONSE"
Makes sense - she's probably still in medical treatment, sedated for the rib work.
Chen's voice comes through again: "Dax, I've been thinking. That Weyland rep who showed up during your debrief? They were awfully quick to get here. Like they were waiting for us."
She's right. The Wanderer only docked maybe an hour ago, but Weyland already had insurance claims filed and a representative demanding access to survivors.
The comms terminal blinks again - J.PARK's message is still waiting.
Chen adds: "Oh, and our U.E.S. rep already messaged me. Jonathan Park. Sounds... nervous. Really nervous."
What does Dax do?

player: "i'm glad you're safe, chen. really i am. we'll talk when the time is right." dax cuts the call. he hopes his nerves about talking too much over surveillance are picked up by chen, lest she just thinks he's being cold. she's too worked up, too prone to spoiling something.
dax turns to the message from 

claude: Chen's expression flickers with hurt confusion before the screen cuts. You'll need to make that right later, but she's too hot right now, too ready to spill everything over monitored comms.
You open Park's message. It's text only, carefully formatted:

TO: D. Stargazer
FROM: J. Park, United 

claude: ions Syndicate (Titan Station Office)
SUBJECT: Condolences and Administrative Matters
Mr. Stargazer,
First, my deepest condolences on the loss of the U.E.S. Wanderer and her crew. Captain Morrison was a valued member of the U.E.S. family.
I have been informed of your survival along with Engineer Chen and Dr. Yuen. This is... unexpected but welcome news.
There are several administrative matters requiring attention:

Survivor benefits paperwork
Standard incident debriefing for U.E.S. records
Coordination with insurance investigators
Next-of-kin notifications for deceased crew

I understand you are in mandatory quarantine for 48 hours. I will visit as soon as permitted. In the meantime, Weyland Biosystems has requested copies of all crew logs and records. As your U.E.S. representative, I must advise you that you are NOT obligated to provide these without legal counsel present.
Please rest and recover. We will handle the formalities when you are ready.
Regards,
Jonathan Park
Senior Administrator (Titan Station)
United 

claude: ions Syndicate
P.S. - The main office has asked me to determine if any backup data cores were recovered. Standard procedure would have been to eject them before abandoning ship. Please advise at your earliest convenience.

That postscript is interesting. Is he fishing for evidence, or hinting that you should have some?
What does Dax do?

player: dax is annoyed with himself. the backups. it wasn't his fault, the memory blocker was still active while he was on the bridge. the captain never mentioned it either, but... he was in no state to think corporate.dax heads to a mirror, splashes his face and begins to practice his spiel for the debrief. largely the same information he went over with the director, but with more detail about the captain and the other crew they saw while there.
he considers how much he should say about weyland, but remembers the conversation will be being watched. he'll need to articulate so he's not lying, and so that he can fill in the gaps about weyland later.he also considers survivor benefits. this is no time to take a corp apartment on titan and rest up. he needs to get back out there - this is no mystery that'll be solved on titan alone. he wonders if the benefits could get him a modest ship instead. he could take on small shipping requests to make some cash while focusing on his true mission. on... their true mission? would chen and yuen join him, he thinks to himself. chen would make a great captain. a doctor would be very useful 

claude: The mirror shows a tired Vexian face - your mandibles slightly drooped, your compound eyes dulled from stress. The cold water helps, though it's strange on your chitinous features compared to human skin.
You run through the story again, rehearsing. Morrison's heroism. The crew you couldn't save. The "artifacts" with no further detail. The quarantine he maintained. Each word carefully true but incomplete. You can fill the gaps later when you're not being recorded by who-knows-how-many parties.
The survivor benefits... standard U.E.S. package would be:

Three months salary continuation
Trauma counseling (which you'll definitely refuse)
Temporary housing on any U.E.S.-affiliated station
OR a lump sum of about 15,000 Universal 

claude: s

That lump sum... it's not enough for a ship. Not even close. Even a rusty single-berth courier would run 50,000 minimum. But if Chen and Yuen pooled their benefits too - 45,000 

claude: s. Add in whatever savings you each have...
You think about Chen. She'd spent three years on the Wanderer, worked her way up from junior engineer. She's got the temperament for command when she's not running hot. And she's already proven she can handle herself in crisis.
Dr. Yuen... she knows more than she's said. That comment about you asking her to place the memory lock - that suggests you trusted her three weeks ago with dangerous knowledge. A ship's doctor who can keep secrets might be invaluable.
But would they follow you on what might be a revenge quest disguised as justice?
The comms terminal chimes. New message from C-5 (Chen): "Dax, I get it. Wrong time. But we need to sync our stories before official debrief. 47 hours to get it right."
She got your message about surveillance. Smart.
What does Dax do?

player: dax goes over what he'd practiced in the mirror, making sure to earnestly fill in bits he'd forgotten with chen's knowledge of events. to anyone listening in, it wouldn't sound like conspiracy, just two survivors helping each others memories.
the gaps regarding weyland are, hopefully, picked up on by chen as being intentional, and are left as mysteries for 

claude: You open the comm to Chen, keeping your voice steady and professional. "Chen, you're right. We should go over the timeline. Make sure we have everything straight."
"Yeah," she says, catching your tone immediately. "Let's start from when you woke up in Medical."
You methodically walk through the events. The cryo-pod malfunction. The damaged ship. Finding the logs about an "unidentified biological signature in the cargo bay." You describe the Skitterers in detail, the infected crew, the amalgamation creature.
"The Captain mentioned he'd acquired some artifacts for transport," you say carefully. "But he never told us the specifics. Just cargo, as far as we knew."
Chen nods slowly on screen. "Right. Morrison handled all acquisitions. We just... transported things." Her voice is perfectly neutral. She's caught on.
You continue through the story - Rostova's sacrifice, the armory code 7355, the plasma injector repair, Morrison's final stand.
"The cargo bay was covered in that organic residue," Chen adds. "Whatever was in those containers, it got out. Poor containment? Damaged in transit? Who knows."
"Who knows," you agree.
You both carefully review each crew member you encountered, living and dead. The story is complete, consistent, and thoroughly missing any mention of your recovered memories or Martinez's data log.
"I think we have it straight," Chen finally says. "Same story for the U.E.S. debrief tomorrow."
"Agreed. Get some rest, Chen."
She gives you a long look through the screen. "You too, Dax. We're going to need our strength for whatever comes next."
The call ends. Your story is synchronized. The official version, anyway.
What does Dax do?

player: dax is exhausted. but there's something left on his mind. who was handling cargo on the ship? he'd been by to help with some checks and repairs, sure, but he wasn't a cargo worker.
he looks around for something that might help him investigate, one more piece of the puzzle before he turns 

claude: You pace the small quarters, your mind churning. The cargo manifests. Someone had to handle the physical loading, sign off on the containers, supervise the storage...
The room's comm terminal has basic station directory access. You search for U.E.S. Wanderer crew records - they're part of the incident report, technically public within the investigation.
The manifest appears:

Captain Morrison - commanded acquisitions
Cargo Chief Ramirez - killed first, Chen mentioned
Loading Supervisor Martinez - Chen has his data log
Cargo Specialist Yuen, D. -

Wait. Yuen, D.
Not ship's doctor. Dr. Yuen was listed as Cargo Specialist with medical certification. She'd have been responsible for biological cargo, anything requiring special environmental controls. She'd have signed off on those containers.
Your memory flashes - three weeks ago, going to her about the suspicious manifests. She'd helped you, yes, but she'd also have been the one who cleared those "artifacts" for storage in the first place.
Another piece clicks. Her insistence in the Med Bay about telling you the memory lock code, even while injured and low on oxygen. Her knowledge that the Captain was tricked. She knew because she'd have been part of the acquisition process.
The terminal blinks with another update - Dr. Yuen's status has changed to "Conscious - Restricted Communication per Medical Protocol."
She's awake. And she has a lot more to explain than just your memory lock.
You're exhausted, running on fumes, but this revelation sits heavy in your mind.
What does Dax do?

player: dax wants nothing more than to keep digging, keep asking questions. but nothing he can ask yuen right now would be anything they want being overheard. 
he sends her a message hoping she's well, wishing her a good night and assuring her that they'll talk first thing in the morning.
dax performs whatever night routine vexians perform and goes to 

claude: You send a brief message to Dr. Yuen: "Glad you're recovering. Rest well. We'll speak in the morning."
The quarters' lights dim automatically as you move toward the bed, adjusting to Vexian preferences - softer, more amber than the harsh white humans prefer.
You perform your evening khett-sa, the 

claude: ative stretching routine your people developed in the low-gravity caverns of home. Each of your four arms extends in sequence, chitinous joints clicking softly as you work out the tension of the last few days. It's the first time you've had space and privacy for the ritual since before... everything.
You clean your mandibles with the provided hygiene kit (thankfully, Titan Station stocks multi-species supplies), and run a damp cloth over your compound eyes - they've been dry and irritated from all the recycled ship air and smoke.
The bed is surprisingly comfortable, with adjustments for various anatomies. You arrange yourself in the Vexian sleeping position - lower arms folded beneath you, upper arms free (an evolutionary holdover from when your ancestors needed to be ready to catch themselves if they fell from cave walls during sleep).
As exhaustion finally claims you, your mind churns with questions. Yuen's cargo role. Martinez's data. Weyland's timing. The Director's careful probing. But for now, for just a few hours, you need rest.
Tomorrow will bring the official debriefs. And somehow, you need to navigate them without revealing what you know, while figuring out who you can actually trust.
Sleep takes you, deep and dreamless.

[Shall we continue with the next morning, or would you like to save here?]

player: (let's save and readjust the artefact!)
ooc question, what species' are chen and yuen? i think dax called one of them human earlier but that might just have been me assuming. dax probably wouldn't know their back stories ( maybe yuen, but he doesn't quite remember), but he can see them 

claude: (OOC: Good question! I actually haven't specified their species - let me establish that now:
Chen is human - fairly typical spacer stock, probably from one of the asteroid colonies based on her engineering background. Dark hair, compact build from growing up in artificial gravity, maybe early 30s.
Dr. Yuen is also human, but likely from one of the core worlds given her medical training and dual specialization. More polished than typical frontier crew. Maybe late 30s, early 40s.
Humans still make up about 60-70% of most crews since human companies like U.E.S. tend to hire their own species preferentially (not policy, just unconscious bias). Dax being Vexian made him a bit of an outsider on the crew, though his technical skills spoke for themselves.
You're right that Dax wouldn't know their full backstories yet, especially with the memory lock having been in place. He'd know Chen has been on the ship for 3 years and worked her way up. Yuen... well, he's just discovering she wasn't quite what she seemed.
Good catch on me being vague about this - it's important to know who your allies actually are!
Let me update the artifact's campaign notes to reflect where we are in the story...)D&D Solo Campaign CompanionInteractive artifact ∙ Version 33 Updated! The artifact now has the current story state saved. We're paused at:

End of Day 1 in quarantine
Dax has discovered Dr. Yuen was the cargo specialist
Stories are synchronized with Chen
Everyone's resting for tomorrow's official debrief
47 hours of quarantine remaining

This is a great stopping point. When we continue, it'll be the morning with the U.E.S. debrief looming and Dax needing to carefully navigate the political waters while figuring out if he can trust Yuen with what she knows.
Save the artifact and you can pick this up anytime! The campaign notes have everything needed to continue the story.

player: one piece of feedback - i don't think we had a single roll during day 1 lol. let's not just have rolls for action - stuff like dax looking for weyland influence, chen picking up on the surveillance vibes. i'll often  nudge as well by saying like "dax tries to", "attempts to", "hopes that" 

claude: You're absolutely right! Day 1 was way too smooth - I should have been calling for rolls during the investigation and social moments. Good catches on where rolls should have happened:

Dax examining the station for Weyland influence: Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation)
Chen picking up surveillance hints: Wisdom (Insight)
Dax trying to stay calm with the Director: We did roll that one at least!
Maybe even Dax recognizing Yuen's cargo role: Intelligence (Investigation)

I'll be much better about calling for rolls during non-combat scenes. Social encounters, investigation, noticing details, trying to deceive or persuade - all need rolls to add tension and uncertainty. The dice should be part of the storytelling, not just the action scenes.
And yes, I'll watch for those verbal cues - "tries to," "attempts to," "hopes that" are all perfect indicators that you want to roll for something.
Thanks for the feedback! When we pick up with Day 2, expect a lot more skill checks as Dax navigates the political minefield of debriefs and investigations. Those Charisma rolls are going to be rough with his +0 modifier...
Ready to continue whenever you are! The morning debrief with the nervous Mr. Park should definitely involve some rolls to see what Dax can learn (or hide).

player: also i'm a noob when it comes to this kinda thing, but is training a thing? like to bring the str -1 to a 0 or get +1 in cha? does it happen naturally over time? or is it locked tf in? whatever's 'the norm' is good for 

claude: In D&D 5e (which we're loosely using), stats are usually locked in at character creation. BUT! There are a few common ways DMs handle improvement:
Standard Options:

Ability Score Improvements (ASI) - Every 4 levels, you can add +2 to one stat or +1 to two stats (can't go above 20)
Feats - Sometimes instead of ASI, you can take a feat that might give +1 to a stat plus other benefits
Magic items - Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Headband of Intellect, etc.

Training (Optional Rule):
Some DMs allow downtime training - like spending weeks/months and 

claude: s to improve a weak stat by 1. Makes narrative sense that Dax could hit the gym during long space flights to get that STR from -1 to 0.
My Suggestion for Our Game:

Every 2-3 "chapters" (major story arcs), you get an ASI
Training during downtime costs 

claude: s and time (like 30 days and 1000 

claude: s to raise a stat by 1, max once per stat)
Story moments might grant improvements (like if you do lots of diplomacy, maybe earn +1 CHA)

So yeah, Dax could eventually get less terrible at strength or more charismatic, but it'll take time and effort. Sound good? We can keep it flexible and story-driven rather than strict XP tracking.
What feels right for the campaign to you?

player: yeah that sounds good to me bossmanlet's go day 

claude: DAY 2 - TITAN STATION QUARANTINE
You wake to the soft chime of the quarters' alarm. 0700 station time. Your compound eyes adjust to the rising lights, taking in Saturn's pale gold through the viewport.
Your body feels better - the first real rest you've had in days. The khett-sa stretches helped, though your lower left arm is sore from all that ladder climbing on the Wanderer.
The comm terminal shows:

3 new messages from J. Park
1 message from Dr. Yuen
System Notice: Debrief scheduled 0900 with U.E.S. Representative

Dr. Yuen's message is simple: "We need to talk. Before the debrief. Please."
Park's messages are increasingly nervous reminders about documentation, procedures, and "the importance of accurate record-keeping."
The beverage dispenser hums invitingly. The Vexian equivalent of coffee - a warm, slightly acidic brew from your homeworld - might help clear your head.
You have two hours before the official debrief. Time to figure out if you can trust Dr. Yuen with what you know, or if she's been playing you from the start.
Roll a Wisdom (Insight) check (d20 + 1) to see if you can read between the lines of Yuen's message - is her urgency desperation or manipulation?
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 17 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Wisdom (Insight) check: 18 (Success!)
Reading the message again, you parse the subtext. The punctuation, the timing, the simple directness - this isn't manipulation. This is someone who's been carrying guilt and needs to confess before they lose their nerve.
She sent it at 0400 station time. She's been awake all night wrestling with this.
The "Before the debrief" is key - she wants to come clean to you before the official story gets locked in. Someone planning to manipulate you would wait until after, see what you say officially first.
You grab your Vexian coffee - bitter and sharp, perfect for cutting through the morning fog - and open a comm to C-9.
Dr. Yuen appears on screen immediately. She looks exhausted despite the medical treatment, dark circles under her eyes. The regenerative gel has closed her wounds, but her expression shows a different kind of pain.
"Dax," she starts, then stops. Swallows. "I know you've figured it out. Cargo Specialist. I... I signed off on those containers. The manifests said archaeological specimens. Inert biological samples. Morrison trusted my assessment."
She's not looking at the camera, staring at something off-screen.
"Three weeks ago, when you came to me with your suspicions, I should have admitted it then. But I was scared. Scared I'd been fooled. Scared I'd killed us all through incompetence." Her voice cracks slightly. "Then you asked me to help with the memory lock, and I thought... maybe if we could prove Weyland lied, it wouldn't be my fault."
She finally looks directly at you. "I need you to know everything before Park gets here. Before we're on record."
What does Dax do?

player: dax is frustrated, disappointed. he'd be angry if he had the capacity for it - he was never one to succumb to a base instinct like rage. yuen has spilled it all, with god-knows-who listening.
he doesn't blame her for her part in bringing those things onto the ship. but her desperation has shown their hand, and now he and chen look like liars from their conversation the day before.
... unless... surprise... he has to act surprised. like he didn't know any of this. chen will get it, she always does.
dax thanks yuen for plugging the gaps in information. he suggests they bring chen in on this call, so she can learn this "new" context 

claude: Your mandibles tighten - the Vexian equivalent of a clenched jaw - as you process what just happened. Yuen just confessed to signing off on the cargo over monitored comms. Whoever's listening now knows you and Chen held back information yesterday.
But you force surprise into your voice, playing the only card you have: "You... you signed off on them? Dr. Yuen, I had no idea you were cargo specialist. This changes..." you pause, as if processing. "This changes everything. Chen needs to hear this."
You can see Yuen's confusion at your formal tone, but you push forward, adding Chen to the call.
Chen's face appears, still groggy. "What's going—"
"Chen, Dr. Yuen just informed me she was actually the cargo specialist. She signed off on those containers." You put just enough shock in your voice for the recording.
Chen's eyes sharpen instantly, reading the situation. "What? Doc, you were... but you never said anything on the ship."
"I know," Yuen says miserably. "I was scared. When everything went wrong, I—"
"You should have told us immediately," Chen cuts in, playing her part perfectly. "We've been trying to piece together what happened, and you had critical information this whole time?"
Roll a Deception check (d20 + 0 with your Charisma) to see if your surprised act is convincing enough for whoever's monitoring this call.
What do you roll?

player: fuck lol, I rolled 8 on a 

claude: Deception check: 8 (Failure)
Your acting is stiff, unconvincing. The surprise in your voice sounds hollow even to your own ears - like someone reading from a script they just received.
There's a long pause. Then Yuen's expression changes. Not confusion anymore, but a dawning realization.
"You... you already knew," she says quietly. "Both of you knew."
Chen drops the act immediately. "Doc—"
"No, I get it," Yuen interrupts. "Monitored comms. You were protecting the information. And I just..." She puts her head in her hands. "I just blew it all over an open channel."
The damage is done. Whoever's listening - Weyland, the Director, station security - now knows:

Yuen was responsible for clearing the cargo
You and Chen discovered this information but hid it
You're actively coordinating your stories

A notification pops up on your screen: "Director Holbrook requests your presence. Escort arriving in 5 minutes."
Chen curses. "So much for waiting until 0900."
Yuen looks devastated. "Dax, I'm sorry. I thought... I thought being honest would help. I didn't think about—"
"We adapt," you cut in. No point in recriminations now. "Chen, stick to the story we discussed but be ready to adjust. Yuen, tell them everything about the cargo, but nothing about the memory lock unless directly asked."
The door chime sounds. Your escort is here.
The game has changed. Time to face the Director with your cards partially revealed.
What does Dax do?

player: dax knows the only hand he has left is befriending the director. he's expecting her to be quite angry at this turn of events, but he has to do what he can to win her over. from what he's gleamed from this station so far, she has the power to continue shielding them from weyland and maybe even help... if it's in her 

claude: The security officers are polite but firm. "Mr. Stargazer, the Director requests your immediate presence."
As you walk through the station corridors, you notice more activity than yesterday. Workers pause to stare - word of the Wanderer survivors has spread. You catch whispers: "...only three survived..." "...some kind of infection..." "...Weyland's furious..."
The Director's office is high in the station's central spire. Floor-to-ceiling windows show Saturn's rings in breathtaking detail. Holbrook stands with her back to you, hands clasped behind her.
"Mr. Stargazer. Please sit."
She turns, and her expression isn't angry - it's calculating.
"That was quite the performance this morning. Unfortunately for you, I've been running this station for twelve years. I know bad acting when I hear it."
She sits across from you, placing a tablet on the desk between you. On it, a waveform analysis of your conversation.
"Your stress patterns spiked when Dr. Yuen started talking. Chen's response time was too quick - she was ready for the revelation. You've been coordinating."
She leans back. "Here's what I know: Three survivors from an impossible situation. One turns out to be the cargo specialist who approved the containers. You two knew this but tried to hide it. Why?"
Her eyes are sharp. "I have Weyland breathing down my neck, demanding access to you. I have U.E.S. sending increasingly panicked messages. And I have three survivors who are clearly hiding something bigger than procedural failures."
She stands, moving to the window. "I don't like Weyland, Mr. Stargazer. They throw their weight around, assume 

claude: s buy authority on my station. But I need more than dislike to protect you. I need the truth."
Roll a Wisdom (Insight) check (d20 + 1) to gauge if she's genuinely willing to help or just fishing for information.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 18 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Wisdom (Insight) check: 19 (Success!)
You study her body language, the micro-expressions that even experienced politicians can't fully hide. The way she said "I don't like Weyland" - there was genuine distaste there, maybe even history. The tension in her shoulders when she mentioned them breathing down her neck.
But more telling is what she's not doing. She hasn't called in Weyland's rep. She brought you here alone, no security recording, no legal witnesses. She's giving you a chance to come clean in private.
And that comment about "twelve years running this station" - there's pride there. This is her station. Weyland is just a tenant, and an annoying one at that.
She's fishing for information, yes, but she's also genuinely willing to help if you give her ammunition to work with. She needs something concrete to justify protecting you from Weyland. She's a political creature, but not a corporate puppet.
"Director," you begin carefully, "hypothetically... if someone had evidence that Weyland deliberately misrepresented dangerous biological weapons as archaeological specimens, resulting in the deaths of twenty-three people... what would that be worth?"
She turns from the window slowly, her expression sharp as a blade.
"Hypothetically? That would be worth quite a lot, Mr. Stargazer. Corporate fraud resulting in mass casualties? That would give me grounds to freeze all Weyland operations on this station pending investigation." A thin smile. "They wouldn't be able to touch you or your crew during such an investigation. Might take months. Years, even."
She sits back down, leaning forward. "But I would need proof. Real, concrete evidence. Not suspicions or recovered memories."
What does Dax do?

player: dax spills it all. everything he knows. including the datapad chen hid, the last piece of physical evidence they have. he suggests she (or at least the datapad) be brought here for them to look into. he also explains he made several scans with his med scanner, wherever they're holding 

claude: You take a breath and make the gamble. Everything on the table.
"Three weeks before the incident, I scanned unusual manifest discrepancies. The 'archaeological specimens' had Weyland Biosystems manufacturing tags embedded in their shipping codes. Black market bioweapon indicators. I confronted Morrison - he was genuinely shocked. He'd been sold these as legitimate artifacts."
Holbrook's expression doesn't change, but she's listening intently.
"I went to Dr. Yuen to verify my findings. We planned to document everything, but I was paranoid about corporate retaliation. I had Yuen place a memory lock on me - insurance in case something went wrong. The code was 5-5-3-7, my employee ID reversed."
You continue, "When everything went to hell, I recovered those memories during our escape. But that's just my word. However..." you lean forward, "Chen has Martinez's data log hidden on her person. Martinez was tracking creature movements, documenting the outbreak. And my medical scanner has biological scans of three different organism types - the Skitterers, the infected, and the amalgam creature. All clearly engineered."
"The scanner should have cached data proving these weren't natural organisms. Bioweapon signatures would be unmistakable."
Holbrook reaches for her comm. "Bring Engineer Chen to my office immediately. And retrieve the medical scanner from quarantine storage."
She looks back at you. "If this evidence is what you claim, Mr. Stargazer, then Weyland committed an act of corporate terrorism. That's not just criminal - on a neutral station, that's grounds for complete asset seizure and arrest of all corporate officers."
She pauses. "You understand what you're starting? Weyland won't go down quietly. They have resources, lawyers, private security. They might come after you."
"They already killed my crew," you reply simply.
Roll a Persuasion check (d20 + 0) to see if your honesty and evidence convince Holbrook to fully commit to protecting you and pursuing Weyland.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 20 on a d20 - NAT 

claude: Persuasion check: NATURAL 20! (Critical Success!)
The room goes silent except for the hum of the station's life support. Holbrook stares at you for a long moment, then something shifts in her expression. Decision crystallizing into action.
She stands and walks to a wall panel, pressing her palm against it. A hidden compartment opens, revealing a secure terminal.
"Computer, activate Protocol Seven. Director's Override. All Weyland Biosystems assets on Titan Station are hereby frozen pending investigation of corporate terrorism charges. Security teams to Weyland offices immediately. No communications in or out."
She turns back to you. "Done. As of this moment, you and your crew are under my personal protection as material witnesses in a capital case."
The door chimes. Chen enters, escorted by security, looking worried. "Director, what—"
"Your data log, Engineer. Now."
Chen hesitates, then pulls Martinez's log from an inner pocket. Holbrook slots it into her terminal immediately. Data streams across the screen - timestamps, biological readings, Martinez's voice notes documenting the spreading infection.
"God in heaven," Holbrook breathes. "This is... this is damning."
Another chime. A technician enters with your medical scanner. Holbrook activates it herself, scrolling through the cached scans. The Skitterer's bio-signature, clearly showing engineered markers. The infected crew, with fungal patterns matching known weapon strains. The amalgam creature, a nightmare of directed mutation.
She looks up at both of you. "This isn't just evidence. This is proof of 

claude: ated mass murder."
Her comm buzzes. "Director, Weyland's office is... resisting. Mr. Kellerman is demanding to speak with you."
"Tell Mr. Kellerman he can speak to me after his arrest. Charge him with obstruction if he continues to resist."
She turns back to you. "You've given me everything I need to bury them, but they'll fight back. They'll claim the evidence is fabricated, that you're disgruntled survivors looking for someone to blame. We need more."
"The memory lock," she muses. "If we could get a neural scan showing the tampered memories, proving you hid this information before the incident..."
She smiles, and it's sharp as a blade. "Mr. Stargazer, how would you like to help me destroy Weyland Biosystems?"
What does Dax do?

player: "with pleasure", he replies, "whatever it takes."
he probes for improved hospitalities - secure rooms where he can communicate with chen and yuen in private. as a sign of their mutual trust, he's fine with standard station security surveillance, the kind that the director and/or her sec teams would likely have on all on-station comms. he just doesn't want others listening in any more.
otherwise, he waits to hear what the director has in mind for them.
... them... yuen's not 

claude: "With pleasure," you reply. "Whatever it takes."
"First things first," you continue. "We need secure quarters where my crew can actually communicate. I understand station security needs to monitor us - that's fine, I trust your people. But no more corporate ears, no more wondering who else is listening."
Holbrook nods. "Done. I'll move you to Section A - diplomatic quarters. My security team monitors those directly, no external feeds. You'll have privacy from everyone except my most trusted staff."
Chen shifts uncomfortably. "Director, Dr. Yuen isn't here. She needs to know what's happening."
"She's being briefed now," Holbrook replies. "My medical chief is with her. She'll be moved to join you once she's stable enough."
The Director pulls up a holographic display of the station. "Here's what I need from you. Weyland's local operations are frozen, but their corporate headquarters on Europa will respond within 48 hours. They'll send lawyers, private security, maybe worse. Before that happens, we need to build an airtight case."
She highlights several locations on the map. "First, we need that neural scan of your memory lock - my medical team can do that. Second, I want you to work with my investigators to create a complete timeline. Every detail, every crew member, every piece of evidence."
"But here's the real play," she leans forward. "Kellerman doesn't know you've talked to me yet. He thinks you're still in quarantine, still accessible. I want to let him think that. When he reaches out - and he will - you record everything. Let him incriminate himself."
Chen grins darkly. "You want us to be bait."
"I want you to be justice," Holbrook corrects. "Twenty-three people are dead. Someone at Weyland made that decision. I want to know who."
A thought occurs to you. "Director, the Wanderer's black box. Emergency data core. It would have automatically ejected before the ship was lost. If we could retrieve it..."
Her eyes sharpen. "That would have everything. Logs, communications, sensor data. Where would it be?"
"Still floating near Saturn's rings, broadcasting a retrieval signal. But Weyland will be looking for it too."
Roll an Intelligence check (d20 + 3) to remember the specific emergency protocols and estimate the black box's current location.
What do you roll?

player: balls, I rolled 2 on a d20 +3 for 

claude: Intelligence check: 5 (Critical Failure)
Your mind goes completely blank. The emergency procedures, the ejection protocols, the orbital mechanics - it all turns to static in your head. The stress of the past few days, the memory lock, the lack of sleep - it all crashes down at once.
"I... I can't remember," you admit, frustrated. "The black box would have ejected when Morrison initiated final protocols, but the trajectory..." You rub your compound eyes with one hand. "It's gone. I can't calculate it."
Chen steps in. "Standard protocol is ejection perpendicular to ship's trajectory. The Wanderer was in Saturn's orbit, so—"
"That's a search area of millions of cubic kilometers," Holbrook interrupts. "Without precise calculations, it could take weeks to find. And Weyland probably has the ship's last telemetry data from their insurance claim."
She thinks for a moment. "We'll have to work with what we have. The evidence here is strong, but that black box would be the killing blow." She taps her terminal. "I'll dispatch a recovery team to search, but don't count on it."
A notification appears on her screen. "Speaking of Weyland, Mr. Kellerman is demanding his comm access be restored. He wants to speak with the survivors." She looks at you. "Ready to play bait? Remember, he doesn't know you've given me the evidence yet."
"Director," Chen says, "what about Park? Our U.E.S. rep? He's supposed to debrief us this morning."
"Mr. Park can wait. This takes priority." Holbrook stands. "I'll have you moved to Section A within the hour. Get some rest, then we'll set up the call with Kellerman. Make him think you're still scared, isolated survivors. Let him make his threats or his bribes."
She pauses at the door. "Oh, and Mr. Stargazer? That memory of yours better come back. We might need those calculations yet."
What does Dax do?

player: dax's frustration boils over. he knows he knows where the black box would be, but it's all just been too much.
he also knows he's no actor. he asks chen how confident she is that she can hoodwink kellerman, hoping she might be able to take the lead. but she's an engineer, not an entertainer... they might have to struggle through this 

claude: Your four fists clench in frustration. "I KNOW this information. Morrison drilled emergency procedures into everyone. But it's just... gone." You slam one hand on the table, making Chen jump.
"Easy, Dax," she says. "We've been through hell. Your brain's probably protecting you from—"
"My brain is failing when we need it most," you cut her off, then immediately regret your tone. "Sorry. I just..."
Chen waves it off. "Look, about Kellerman - I'm an engineer, not a con artist. I can try to lead, but..." she grimaces. "Remember when I tried to bluff those inspectors about the coolant leak last year? Morrison had to step in before I got us all fined."
You manage a weak laugh despite everything. "You told them it was 'supposed to be that color.'"
"Green coolant in a system that uses blue. Yeah, not my finest moment." She sobers. "But we don't have a choice. We have to try."
"Together then," you say. "Play up the trauma. We're scared survivors who just want this over with."
Chen nods. "I can do scared. Hell, I don't even have to act for that part."
The door opens. Dr. Yuen enters in a wheelchair, pushed by a medical technician. She looks pale but determined.
"I heard everything," she says quietly. "Holbrook briefed me. I want to help with Kellerman." She meets your eyes. "I owe you both that much. I'm the one who signed those containers. Let me take some of the heat."
Roll an Insight check (d20 + 1) to gauge if Yuen is stable enough to handle a confrontation with Kellerman.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 17 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Insight check: 18 (Success!)
Looking at Dr. Yuen, you see past the wheelchair and the medical monitors. Her hands are steady. Her breathing is controlled despite the pain medication. Most importantly, her eyes have a clarity that wasn't there this morning - the confusion and guilt have crystallized into determination.
She's not just stable; she's focused. The guilt is driving her, but not clouding her judgment. If anything, she might be your best asset here - Kellerman won't expect the "guilty" cargo specialist to be working against him.
"You're ready," you tell her. "But we need a plan. Kellerman will try to divide us, use your guilt against you."
"Let him," Yuen says firmly. "I did sign those containers. That part's true. But I was deceived, and I have the certification logs to prove the containers were sealed and labeled as inert specimens. The fraud was on Weyland's end."
Chen nods. "So we stick to partial truths. We're scared, we want this over, but we don't volunteer anything."
Director Holbrook re-enters. "Your new quarters are ready. Section A, diplomatic wing. My personal security chief, Commander Torres, will oversee your protection. She's... thorough."
She hands you a secure comm unit. "This links directly to my office. Use it if Kellerman crosses any lines. And remember - he's going to try to isolate you, make individual deals. Don't let him."
The three of you are escorted to Section A. The difference is immediate - real windows, a common area where you can meet, individual rooms that connect. It feels less like a prison and more like a safe house.
An hour later, the comm terminal chimes.
"Mr. Kellerman, Weyland Biosystems, requesting communication with survivors of U.E.S. Wanderer."
Chen looks at you. "Showtime."
What does Dax do?

player: dax gives a final comment, reassuring but reminding the truth is only for the director, and allows kellerman 

claude: "Remember," you say quietly, "we're scared survivors who want this over. The truth about Weyland is only for the Director. Nothing about memory locks, nothing about what we knew before."
Chen and Yuen nod. You accept the call.
The screen fills with a man in an expensive suit - mid-40s, sharp features, predator's smile. Behind him, a pristine office with Weyland's logo prominent.
"Survivors of the Wanderer," Kellerman begins, voice smooth as oil. "I'm James Kellerman, Senior Liaison for Weyland Biosystems. First, let me express our deepest condolences for your ordeal and the loss of your colleagues."
He doesn't wait for a response. "I understand there's been some confusion about the cargo we contracted with Captain Morrison. Very tragic how improper handling led to such catastrophic results."
The accusation hangs there, baited hook.
Dr. Yuen shifts in her wheelchair. Chen's jaw tightens.
"We're reviewing the incident for our insurance claim," Kellerman continues. "However, we've noticed some... discrepancies in your initial statements to Station Security. Different versions of events. Memory gaps." His eyes find you specifically. "Mr. Stargazer, your medical scan showed neurological anomalies. That must be concerning."
He leans forward. "Weyland values truth. We're prepared to offer substantial compensation - enough to set you up for life - in exchange for accurate testimony about Captain Morrison's negligence in handling our legitimate archaeological specimens."
Roll an Insight check (d20 + 1) to read between the lines of his offer and threat.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 10 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Insight check: 11 (Partial Success)
You catch the surface-level threat clearly enough - he knows about your memory anomaly and he's dangling money versus the implied threat of using your "unreliable" testimony against you. But there's something else underneath his smooth delivery that you can't quite parse.
The compensation offer is obvious bribery. The threat about "discrepancies" is meant to make you doubt yourselves. But why is he so confident? He's acting like he holds cards you don't know about.
Chen speaks first, voice carefully controlled. "Mr. Kellerman, we've been through severe trauma. Of course our initial statements might have gaps. We watched our friends die."
"Of course, of course," Kellerman says smoothly. "Trauma can affect memory. Make people... misremember things. Even believe things that didn't happen. Expert witnesses would testify to that."
There it is - he'd paint you as delusional if needed.
Dr. Yuen leans forward slightly. "I signed off on those containers personally, Mr. Kellerman. They were sealed and labeled as inert archaeological specimens. My certification logs show that clearly."
His smile doesn't waver. "Dr. Yuen, your recent medical trauma is concerning. Head injuries, blood loss, oxygen deprivation - all can affect recall. And your... personal relationship with the deceased Captain might cloud your judgment about his actions."
Personal relationship? You and Chen exchange glances. Was there something between Yuen and Morrison?
"What exactly are you offering?" you ask, keeping your voice neutral.
"250,000 

claude: s. Each. Plus passage to any system you choose. All medical expenses covered. In exchange for truthful testimony that acknowledges the captain's failure to follow proper containment protocols."
What does Dax do?

player: dax starts a much less detailed recollection of events than he's given previously. he leans into painting the captain as a hero. he also looks over to yuen at key moments, hoping she can take over the narrative - she seems much better at this than him and 

claude: You begin slowly, carefully. "Captain Morrison maintained quarantine protocols even as he was dying. He could have opened the escape pods immediately, saved himself, but he knew the risk to the station."
You look at Yuen, catching her eye. She picks up smoothly.
"Mr. Kellerman, I worked with Captain Morrison for two years," she says, her voice steady. "He was meticulous about procedures. When those containers arrived, every seal was intact. Every documentation code checked out. The manifests said archaeological specimens from site LV-426. Inert. Safe."
Kellerman's smile tightens slightly. "Documentation can be misread, Dr. Yuen."
"Not by Morrison," Chen jumps in, finding her confidence. "I watched him spend three hours once verifying a single shipping code because one digit looked off. If those containers had shown any sign of biological hazard, he would have spaced them immediately."
You continue your simplified account - the creatures, the infection, the crew's desperate fight. You leave out anything about your prior knowledge, the memory lock, Martinez's detailed logs. Just scared survivors remembering a nightmare.
"The captain's final words," you say, letting real emotion creep in, "were to tell everyone what happened. To make sure no one else suffered like our crew did."
Kellerman's expression shifts. "A touching story. But emotions don't change facts. Weyland shipped legitimate specimens. If contamination occurred, it was during transport."
"Then why," Yuen asks quietly, "did you already have insurance claims filed before we even docked? Before any investigation?"
The silence stretches. Kellerman's smile returns, but colder.
"Standard corporate efficiency. Now, about our offer..."
Roll a Persuasion check (d20 + 0) to see if your group's unified front is starting to frustrate Kellerman into revealing more.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 14 on a 

claude: Persuasion check: 14 (Success!)
Kellerman's composure cracks, just slightly. His jaw tightens, and he leans back in his chair - the first defensive gesture he's made.
"Our offer," he says, voice harder now, "is generous considering the circumstances. Considering that U.E.S. will likely fold after paying out damages. Considering that you three will be unemployable once word spreads that you were on the contamination ship."
There it is - the stick after the carrot.
"But perhaps," he continues, "we should discuss individual arrangements. Dr. Yuen, as the cargo specialist who signed off on these containers, you bear particular responsibility. Weyland could pursue criminal negligence charges. Or... we could ensure your medical license transfers smoothly to a core world hospital. Your choice."
He's trying to split you up, just as Holbrook predicted.
"Mr. Stargazer, your memory anomaly makes you an unreliable witness. No court would take your testimony seriously. But 250,000 

claude: s could buy excellent neurological treatment."
"And Ms. Chen, junior engineers are easily replaced. But with Weyland's recommendation, you could have your own ship to run."
Yuen's knuckles are white as she grips her wheelchair arms. Chen's face is flushed with anger.
"We should discuss this together," you say carefully. "As a crew."
Kellerman's smile turns predatory. "Oh, but Mr. Stargazer, there is no crew anymore. The Wanderer is destroyed. Morrison is dead. You're just three individuals with potentially conflicting interests."
He stands. "I'll give you 24 hours to consider. Each of you. Separately. My direct line will be open for individual negotiations."
He reaches to cut the connection, then pauses. "Oh, one more thing. Weyland's security division has been alerted to potential theft of proprietary biological data. If any such data were to surface, we would pursue it vigorously. Such theft carries a twenty-year sentence."
The screen goes dark.
Chen explodes. "That slimy, threatening—"
"He just admitted it," Yuen interrupts quietly. "Proprietary biological data. Not archaeological specimens. He just confirmed they knew what it was."
What does Dax do?

player: dax perks up at yuen's last comment. he frantically checks the terminal to see if it might have been recording. he asks yuen to call the director and see if they were listening, recording. 

claude: Your four arms move in a blur across the terminal, searching for any recording function. The diplomatic suite's comm system is more advanced than the quarantine rooms - there has to be something...
Roll a Technology check (d20 + 3) to see if you can find evidence the conversation was recorded.
While you're searching, Yuen is already reaching for the secure line Holbrook gave you. "Director, this is Dr. Yuen. Did you—"
"We monitor all incoming corporate communications to diplomatic quarters," Holbrook's voice comes through immediately. "Yes, we have it. Mr. Kellerman's admission about 'proprietary biological data' is now part of the official record."
Chen lets out a whoop of triumph. "He slipped! The bastard actually slipped!"
"Don't celebrate yet," Holbrook warns. "He'll claim it was a figure of speech, that he meant the archaeological specimens had proprietary value. But it's a crack in their story. Combined with other evidence..."
She pauses. "Mr. Stargazer, are you recording this conversation as well?"
Your fingers are still dancing across the terminal interface, looking for the system's recording cache.
What did you roll for the Technology check? The result will determine what else you might find in the system - possibly even a way to retrieve past communications or hidden functions in the diplomatic suite's systems.

player: Technology check: 22 (rolled 

claude: Technology check: 22 (Critical Success!)
Your fingers fly across the terminal with the fluid precision that made you the Wanderer's best tech specialist. The diplomatic suite's system isn't just advanced - it's deliberately transparent, designed for exactly this kind of situation.
"Got it!" You pull up the system architecture. "Director, this entire suite is wired for diplomatic protection protocols. Everything coming in or out is triple-cached - local storage, security backup, and..." your mandibles click in satisfaction, "legal archive with tamper-proof timestamps."
"Correct," Holbrook confirms. "The diplomatic wing was designed for exactly these situations. Corporate intimidation of witnesses is, sadly, not uncommon."
But you're not done. Your successful probing reveals something else - a hidden partition in the system showing ALL of Kellerman's recent communication attempts.
"Director, he's been trying to contact us individually for the past two hours," you report, scanning the logs. "Sixteen attempts to reach Dr. Yuen's private terminal, twelve to Chen's, eight to mine. All blocked by your security protocols."
"The man's desperate," Chen observes. "He knows he messed up."
Yuen is studying the recording playback on her screen. "There - right there. When he said 'proprietary biological data,' his left eye twitched. It's a tell. He knew he'd made an error the moment he said it."
Your exploration also reveals something interesting: "Director, your security chief Torres has been routing all of Kellerman's attempted communications through a forensic analyzer. She's building a pattern profile - trying to predict his next move."
"Torres is thorough," Holbrook says with satisfaction. "Now, we have 24 hours before his deadline. He'll try to circumvent our protections, maybe even attempt physical contact. Be ready."
The terminal beeps. Another incoming message - this time from Jonathan Park, U.E.S.
"Official debrief in one hour," his message reads. "Director Holbrook has provided secure conference room. Please be prepared to give full accounting of events."
Chen looks at the message queue. "Kellerman's still trying to call. Every thirty seconds now."
"Let him sweat," Yuen says with unusual firmness. "We have what we need."
What does Dax do? You have an hour before the official U.E.S. debrief, Kellerman's admission on record, and a increasingly desperate corporate lawyer trying to contact you.

player: ask the director what she advises we do with 

claude: "Director," you say, pulling up Park's nervous profile from yesterday, "what do you recommend we tell Park? He's our employer's rep, but he's clearly out of his depth."
Holbrook considers. "Jonathan Park is a middle manager who thought he'd gotten a cushy station posting. He's not equipped for this level of corporate warfare. That said, he's not your enemy - he's just terrified of losing U.E.S. even more money."
"So we tell him...?" Chen prompts.
"The truth, but carefully. He needs to file his report to U.E.S. headquarters. If he panics and writes something that contradicts your statements, Kellerman will use it. Keep it simple: you were hired for a salvage run, Morrison was given falsified cargo manifests, Weyland is trying to blame you for their deception."
Torres's voice cuts in over the comm. "Director, Kellerman just tried to physically enter Section A. My team turned him away, but he's claiming legal right to access his company's 'stolen property.'"
"He means Martinez's data log," Yuen says quietly.
Holbrook's tone sharpens. "He has no such rights. Torres, maintain security. Now, survivors - Park is essentially harmless but he's also transparent. Assume anything you tell him will be public knowledge within hours. He can't help it; when he's nervous, he talks."
The terminal shows another blocked call from Kellerman, then a text message that somehow got through: "Individual offers expire in 23 hours. Consider your futures carefully."
"One more thing," Holbrook adds. "Park's already received three separate 'briefings' from Kellerman's legal team. They're trying to confuse him with technical details. Keep your story clear and consistent. Don't let him get tangled in Weyland's web."
Chen checks the time. "Forty-five minutes until Park arrives."
What does Dax do to prepare? Would you like to coordinate your story with Chen and Yuen, review any evidence, or make any other preparations before the U.E.S. debrief?

player: dax thanks the director and assures her they're on it before ending the call naturally.
he turns to chen and yuen and says something to the effect of, obviously we're not taking weyland's deal, right? mostly in jest, partly an earnest ask just in case either of the other two are 

claude: "Thanks, Director. We're on it," you say, closing the connection with a polite nod.
You turn to Chen and Yuen, letting out a dry laugh - a clicking sound from your throat that humans find unsettling but your crewmates have learned means amusement. "So, obviously we're not taking Kellerman's deal... right?"
The question hangs half-joking, but you watch their faces carefully. After everything, you need to know they're solid.
Chen snorts. "Oh sure, let me just sell my soul for a ship to run. Because working for the company that murdered our crew sounds like a real career boost." She shakes her head. "Besides, they'd probably space me the first time I asked too many questions."
Yuen is quieter, staring at her hands. For a moment, you worry she might actually be considering it. Then she looks up. "They killed Morrison. They killed everybody. They tried to kill us." Her voice is steady, cold. "I signed those containers because I was deceived. But if I take their money now, knowing what they are? Then I really am complicit."
She shifts in her wheelchair. "Besides, twenty years for theft of biological data? They're threatening us with prison while offering bribes. That tells me they're scared of what we know."
"Martinez's data log," Chen says, patting her pocket where it's hidden. "They don't know we have it, but they're worried we might."
You check the time. Thirty minutes before Park arrives.
"Alright, so we're united. We stick to the simple truth with Park - we were crew doing our jobs, Morrison was a hero, Weyland deceived everyone. Nothing about memory locks or prior knowledge."
Chen grins. "And we let Kellerman stew in his own desperation for 23 more hours."
Roll a Perception check (d20 + 1) to notice something about your surroundings before the debrief.
What do you roll?

player: shit, Perception check: 4 (rolled 3+1)but also, dax starts to worry about martinez' data log. weyland's going nuts trying to get hold of it. he wants to backup the data into something, anything, in as secure a way as possible to maintain its validity as evidence. just in case it gets taken from 

claude: Perception check: 4 (Failed)
You're so focused on the data log problem that you don't notice the subtle hum of surveillance equipment activating in the corner of the room, or the way the air vent grating shifts slightly.
"Chen, we need to backup Martinez's data," you say urgently. "If Weyland's this desperate—"
"Already thinking the same thing," Chen interrupts, pulling out the small device. "But we need to maintain chain of custody for it to be valid evidence. Can't just copy it wildly."
You move to the terminal, your tech expertise kicking in. "The diplomatic suite has forensic data protocols. We can create a legally admissible backup with tamper-proof encryption and timestamp verification."
Roll a Technology check (d20 + 3) to create a secure, legally valid backup of Martinez's data log.
Chen keeps watch by the door while Yuen monitors the communications terminal for any more attempts from Kellerman.
"Twenty minutes until Park," Yuen warns. "And Kellerman just tried calling again. Text message this time: 'Dr. Yuen, your medical future depends on the next 23 hours. Think carefully.'"
"Focusing on her because she seems most vulnerable," Chen observes. "Injured, guilty about the cargo. He's a predator."
The data log's interface glows as you connect it to the terminal. The file sizes are larger than expected - Martinez documented everything. Video logs, shipping manifests, communication records...
"This is it," you mutter, working to establish the secure backup. "This is what terrifies them."
What do you roll for the Technology check?

player: Technology check: 11 (rolled 

claude: Technology check: 11 (Partial Success)
You manage to create a backup, but the process is messier than you'd like. The diplomatic suite's forensic protocols are more complex than expected - designed for legal documents, not military-grade encrypted logs.
"Got it... mostly," you mutter as the progress bar completes. "The backup is secure and timestamped, but I had to compress some of the video files. The manifests and communication records are perfect, but some of Martinez's personal video logs lost resolution."
"Better than nothing," Chen says, but she's frowning. "Wait, did you—"
Suddenly, the terminal flashes a warning: "EXTERNAL ACCESS ATTEMPT DETECTED - BLOCKED"
Your hasty backup triggered a security flag. Someone just tried to piggyback on your connection to access the system.
"Kellerman's team," Yuen says grimly. "They're monitoring for any data transfers."
You quickly check - the backup is secure in the diplomatic suite's legal archive, but now Weyland knows you're doing something with data. They don't know what, but they know you're active.
A knock at the door interrupts. "Mr. Park here for the debrief," comes a nervous voice.
Chen quickly pockets the original data log while you close all the backup protocols.
Park enters, looking even more frazzled than yesterday. His suit is wrinkled, there's coffee stains on his sleeve, and his hands shake slightly as he sets up his recording device.
"I, uh, I need to take your official statements for U.E.S. records," he stammers. "Mr. Kellerman has been... very insistent that I get your full account. He's called me seventeen times this morning."
The poor man looks like he hasn't slept.
"He offered me a promotion," Park says suddenly, then looks horrified at himself. "I mean, he suggested U.E.S. might benefit from... I shouldn't have said that."
Yuen gives you a meaningful look. Kellerman's trying to buy everyone.
What does Dax do?

player: dax starts to try to calm park, and looks to yuen to carry it on.
(btw you can roll for chen and yuen in situations like this)
he then starts into the same spiel again, increasingly more rehearsed. this time, honest but only critical information. less of the gore and emotion, more of the cold 

claude: "Mr. Park, please, sit down. Take a breath," you say gently, gesturing to a chair with one of your lower arms. "You look exhausted."
Yuen smoothly takes over, her medical training showing. "When did you last eat something? Chen, get him some water from the dispenser."
Rolling Persuasion for Yuen (d20+2): 15 (Success!)
Park visibly relaxes as Yuen's calm bedside manner takes effect. "I... thank you. Kellerman's been relentless. He even showed up at my quarters at 0500."
"That's harassment," Chen says flatly, handing him water. "You could file a complaint."
"Against Weyland?" Park laughs bitterly, then takes a shaky sip.
You begin your account, stripped of emotion this time. Just facts. "The Wanderer was contracted for salvage operation. Captain Morrison received cargo containers with manifests listing inert archaeological specimens from LV-426. Dr. Yuen verified the seals and documentation as per protocol. During transit, biological contamination occurred. The organisms were aggressive and infected multiple crew members."
You continue methodically through the timeline. Chen and Yuen occasionally add technical details - Chen about the engineering failures, Yuen about the medical impossibilities of containing the infection.
Park types frantically, trying to keep up. "And the captain?"
"Maintained quarantine protocols until the end," you state simply. "He ensured no contamination reached the escape pods. Saved the station from infection."
Park pauses his typing. "Kellerman says you stole proprietary data."
Rolling Insight for Chen (d20+1): 16 (Success!)
Chen catches your eye - Park isn't accusing, he's fishing. He wants you to give him something to push back against Kellerman with.
"We escaped with our lives and the clothes on our backs," Chen says carefully. "Any logs or records would be standard ship data, property of U.E.S., not Weyland."
Park nods quickly, typing. "Of course. Standard operational records. Property of the ship's owner." He looks up meaningfully. "U.E.S. would have legal claim to any such records, if they existed."
The room goes quiet except for his typing. Then Park asks, "Is there anything else I should know? Officially, I mean. For the record."
What does Dax do?

player: dax looks at the other two and let's park know that's the whole story. it's clear they'll have much better luck with the director than with UES going forward. dax almost begins resigning in his mind as he reaches this realization; grateful though he is with park's apparent 

claude: You exchange glances with Chen and Yuen. "That's the whole story, Mr. Park. Everything relevant to U.E.S.'s needs."
Park nods, still typing, but his shoulders slump slightly. You can see it in his eyes - he knows U.E.S. can't protect you from Weyland. A small shipping company versus a interstellar corporation? The math is brutal.
"I'll file this immediately," Park says quietly. "For what it's worth, I believe you. Morrison was a good captain. But..." he trails off, closing his tablet. "U.E.S. has maybe six months of operating capital left. The insurance claim from losing the Wanderer will bankrupt us. I'll probably be job hunting myself soon."
He stands to leave, then pauses at the door. "Director Holbrook has real authority here. Independent stations have their own laws." He meets your eyes. "I'm just saying, if I were in your position, I'd be thinking about who can actually protect me."
After Park leaves, Chen breaks the silence. "He's basically telling us to jump ship."
"Can you blame him?" Yuen asks. "U.E.S. is done. They can't fight Weyland."
You feel your lower arms curl involuntarily - a Vexian stress response. Your entire career, such as it was, is evaporating. But then again, you're alive. Morrison and the others aren't.
The terminal chimes. Another message from Kellerman: "22 hours remain. Individual meetings can be arranged through secure channels."
Then, unexpectedly, a second message appears - from Director Holbrook: "Mr. Park just filed his report. I'd like to discuss your future options. All three of you. My office, at your convenience."
Chen looks at the competing messages. "Two very different paths."
"Not really," Yuen says firmly. "One's a trap, the other's a lifeline."
What does Dax do?

player: i don't think dax values UES particularly as a 'home', not in a corporate sense. he probably doesn't lament the loss of UES as a company or of his job; he knows he's incredible skilled, he could get a job anywhere. but he has more important things on his mind right now.growing frustrated with kellerman's constant messages, dax looks for a way to block notifications from him on their shared terminal. "pest" he says.
they then go to meet the 

claude: You mutter "Pest" in Vexian - a particularly satisfying curse that sounds like grinding gears - as another notification from Kellerman pops up. Your fingers dance across the terminal, finding the notification settings.
Rolling Technology check (d20+3): 14 (Success!)
You quickly set up a filter that routes all of Kellerman's messages to a separate folder. They'll still be recorded for evidence, but won't interrupt you every thirty seconds.
"There," you say with satisfaction. "He can shout into the void."
Chen grins. "Nice. Now let's go see someone actually worth talking to."
The walk to Holbrook's office takes you through the administrative heart of Titan Station. Unlike the corporate sectors with their logos and polished surfaces, this area feels functional, lived-in. The walls have scuff marks from years of foot traffic. The people you pass nod respectfully but don't stare - they've seen stranger things than a Vexian and his injured crewmates.
Commander Torres meets you at the security checkpoint. "Director's expecting you," she says crisply, then adds in a lower voice, "Kellerman tried to follow you. He's currently enjoying a lengthy security screening."
Holbrook's office overlooks Saturn's rings. The massive gas giant fills half the view, its storms swirling in ancient patterns. The Director stands with her back to you, hands clasped behind her.
"Twelve ships this week have cancelled their docking requests," she says without turning. "Word's already spreading about the contamination incident. Even though we contained it, fear travels faster than truth."
She faces you. "Which brings us to your situation. Park's report makes it clear U.E.S. can't protect you. Kellerman won't stop. And I have a station to protect from both biological contamination and corporate predation."
She gestures to chairs. "So let's discuss realistic options. I can't offer you millions in 

claude: s, but I can offer something Kellerman can't - legitimate legal protection and a chance to see justice done."
"What are you proposing?" Yuen asks.
"Formal refugee status under station law. You'd be under my direct protection while we build a case. My legal team has been studying the recordings. Combined with proper evidence, we might actually nail Weyland for deliberate biological warfare."
She pauses. "But I need complete honesty. No more partial truths. If we're doing this, I need to know everything."
Chen shifts uncomfortably. The data log suddenly feels heavy in her pocket.
What does Dax do?

player: dax looks to the others for agreement, wanting to make sure this is a decision all three of them make together. they've not chosen a 'leader' among them, they're flying by the seat of their pants. 
dax gauges chen's response, though he's confident from her words earlier that she wants the same thing he does - justice. with that, he suggests handing the datapad over to the director to ensure its security. he also lets her know he... tried to back it up to their room terminal, but that her experts might want to take a second look at 

claude: You look between Chen and Yuen, catching their eyes. This needs to be unanimous - you've survived by trusting each other, and that can't change now.
Chen meets your gaze steadily, then gives a small nod. Her hand moves to her pocket protectively, but her expression is resolute.
Yuen doesn't hesitate. "We're in this together," she says simply. "All three of us, or none of us."
You turn back to Holbrook. "We accept. And in the interest of complete honesty..." You gesture to Chen, who slowly pulls out Martinez's data log and places it on the Director's desk.
Holbrook's eyebrows rise slightly. "Is this—"
"Security Chief Martinez's personal log," Chen confirms. "He was documenting irregularities before he died. Everything's on there - shipping manifests, communication records, his own investigations."
"I tried to create a backup on our room's terminal," you add, your mandibles clicking slightly in embarrassment. "The forensic protocols were more complex than expected. Your experts might want to review my attempt - I compressed some files and may have triggered a security flag that Kellerman's team detected."
Rolling Insight for Director Holbrook (d20+3): 18
Holbrook studies the three of you carefully, then picks up the data log with surprising reverence. "Martinez was a good man. Thorough." She activates her comm. "Torres, bring in our digital forensics lead. Full chain of custody protocols."
She turns back to you. "The backup attempt was smart, even if imperfect. We'll secure both versions." She pauses. "Is there anything else? Any other pieces of this puzzle?"
Chen and Yuen look at you. The memory lock is still your secret to share or keep.
What does Dax do?

player: dax looks to yuen for approval to share the memory 

claude: You turn to Yuen, raising an eyebrow in silent question. The memory lock was her work as much as yours - she deserves a say in whether to reveal it.
Yuen hesitates, her fingers drumming nervously on her wheelchair arm. Then she takes a deep breath and nods. "Tell her. All of it."
You face Holbrook. "Three weeks ago, I discovered something about the cargo. Connected some dots about Weyland's involvement. I went to Dr. Yuen with my suspicions."
"And I helped him hide those memories," Yuen continues, her voice steady now. "A neurological lock. Temporary amnesia triggered by specific circumstances. We knew if Weyland was involved, they'd have ways of extracting information. So we made sure there was nothing to extract."
Holbrook leans back slowly. "That's why your medical scan showed anomalies. You deliberately gave yourself brain damage as insurance."
"Reversible," you clarify. "The memories came back during the crisis. But it meant during any initial interrogation, I genuinely couldn't remember what I'd discovered."
"Martinez knew too," Chen adds. "That's probably why he started his detailed documentation."
Torres enters with the forensics lead, a thin man who immediately handles the data log like a holy relic. "Chain of custody begins now," he says, scanning it with a handheld device.
Holbrook stands. "This changes things. 

claude: ated memory suppression suggests you knew the cargo was dangerous enough to warrant extreme measures." She looks at each of you. "You three have been playing a longer game than anyone realized."
"We were trying to survive," you say simply. "And get evidence."
"Well, you succeeded. Torres, implement Protocol Seven. Our three guests are now material witnesses under station protection. Full security detail, restricted access, and..." she smiles slightly, "complete communications blackout from Weyland representatives."
The relief in the room is palpable.
"Kellerman's going to lose his mind," Chen says with satisfaction.
"Let him," Holbrook replies. "We have 21 hours before his deadline. Let's see how desperate he gets when he realizes his prey has found sanctuary."
What does Dax do?

player: dax feels a weight off his shoulders, having let the director know everything. he's confident they've made the right choice in trusting her. 
he suggests the three head back to their room for a chat, with no prying 

claude: The weight that's been crushing your chest for days finally lifts. Your secondary arms, which had been held defensively tight against your body, relax for the first time since you woke from cryo.
"Director, thank you," you say simply. "We should head back to our quarters now. Let you and your team work."
Holbrook nods. "Torres will assign you a discrete security detail. They'll be around but not intrusive. Get some rest - real rest. Tomorrow we start building the case properly."
The walk back feels different. The station corridors seem less oppressive, the recycled air easier to breathe. Even Yuen looks lighter despite her injuries.
Once your quarters' door seals behind you, Chen immediately checks for surveillance devices - old habit from the Wanderer. "We're clean," she confirms.
You settle into chairs facing each other, no terminal between you, no official recording. Just three survivors who've been through hell together.
"So," Chen says, breaking the silence. "We actually did it. We're safe. Relatively speaking."
"For now," Yuen adds, but without her earlier pessimism. "Kellerman won't give up easily."
You lean forward. "We need to talk about what happens next. Not the legal case - us. We're not crew anymore. Park was right about that at least. So what are we to each other now?"
It's the question that's been hovering unasked. Are you three going to stick together after this is over, or will you drift apart once the crisis ends?
"I've been thinking about that," Chen says quietly. "We know each other's worst moments now. Saw each other break and keep going anyway. That's not something you just walk away from."
Yuen shifts in her wheelchair. "Morrison would want us to look out for each other. He died to save us - all of us. That means something."
The room falls quiet, each of you lost in thought about what comes after justice, after survival, after the adrenaline fades.
What does Dax say to his companions about their future?

player: dax suggests they team up - officially. maybe not on paper just yet, not while weyland is still likely watching things like crew manifests and whatever a 'registered team' might look like legally. but dax says dedicating himself to this cause, with these two, for the sake of their crewmates, would be nothing short of an honor.
dax wants to start a conversation to learn about one another. ic it's to learn more about their histories, their strengths. ooc it's to get a gauge for their stats and skills. 
he wants to use it to start the talk of leadership... at this point, dax thinks any one of them could do it, for a multitude of reasons. but yuen's experience, intelliegnce calmness under pressure makes her a solid 

claude: "We should team up - officially," you say, your voice carrying a certainty you haven't felt in days. "Not on paper yet, not while Weyland's watching crew manifests and legal registrations. But dedicating myself to this cause, with you two, for Morrison and the others... it would be an honor."
Chen's eyes brighten. "A team. I like that. Better than drifting apart and always wondering 'what if.'"
"But we need to know each other better," you continue. "Not just as crewmates in crisis, but as people. Our strengths, our backgrounds. If we're doing this, we do it smart."
You lean back. "I'll start. Grew up in the Vexian colony ships - you know how we are about tech and spatial navigation. Four arms help with multitasking. I'm good with systems, patterns, making connections others miss. But I'm terrible at reading people sometimes, and my strength..." you flex one of your thinner upper arms, "let's just say I won't be winning any arm-wrestling contests."
Chen grins. "I noticed. Alright, my turn. Colony kid from Mars, engineering family going back three generations. I can fix anything with moving parts, and I'm quick on my feet - had to be, growing up in the lower sectors. Good in a fight, better at avoiding them. But I'm impulsive, you've probably noticed. Rush in first, think later."
Rolling to determine Chen's stats based on her description:

High DEX and INT, moderate CON and WIS, average STR and CHA

Yuen shifts, considering. "Earth-born, actually. Medical school on Luna. I'm... methodical. Careful. Good under pressure when I have time to think. Obviously medical training, but also biochemistry, some xenobiology." She pauses. "I'm older than both of you. More experienced with corporate politics. But I'm not a fighter, and I overthink things. Freeze when I need to act fast."
Rolling to determine Yuen's stats:

High INT and WIS, moderate CHA, lower DEX and STR, average CON

"Which brings up leadership," you say carefully. "We need someone making decisions when it counts. Yuen, your experience and calmness under pressure—"
"No," Yuen interrupts gently. "I appreciate the thought, but I'm support, not command. I hesitate. We saw that with Kellerman - I needed you two to push back."
Chen looks between you both. "Dax, you kept us alive. You figured out the conspiracy, managed the memory lock, got us to trust Holbrook. You think three steps ahead."
"But I miss social cues," you point out. "Nearly didn't catch Park's signals today."
"So we lead together," Chen suggests. "Play to strengths. Dax for strategy and tech, me for quick decisions and action, Yuen for analysis and keeping us grounded. Shared leadership."
Yuen nods slowly. "Like a proper crew. Different roles, equal voices."
"For Morrison and the others," you say, and the others echo it.
The moment is broken by the terminal chiming - another blocked message from Kellerman. The counter shows 47 attempts in the last hour.
"He's really losing it," Chen observes.
What does Dax want to discuss next with his new partners?

player: money and ties. there's a good chance they'll need to be mobile again soon. it's a tough conversation, but we need to know what resources we're working with. dax is entirely honest about all of it.
1. how much money, capital, etc. they each have
2. what obligations, familial or otherwise, they have and where, in case it becomes a blocker later 

claude: "We need to talk practical matters," you say, settling into a more serious tone. "If things go bad - and with Weyland, they might - we may need to move fast. Be mobile. We should know what resources we're working with."
Chen nods. "Smart. No surprises later."
"I'll start," you offer. "I've got about 3,000 

claude: s in savings. Not much, but I lived cheap on the Wanderer. No family in this system - my clutch-siblings are all back in Vexian space, two months' travel at best. No debts, no obligations. I can move tomorrow if needed."
Chen whistles low. "3,000? That's... responsible. I've got maybe 800 

claude: s. I send most of my pay to my younger brother on Mars - he's in technical school. Parents died in a pressure breach when I was fifteen. Just him and me now." She looks defensive. "I can't abandon him."
"No one's asking you to," Yuen says gently. "Family is family. I've got about 12,000 

claude: s saved. No immediate family - my parents passed years ago, no siblings. But..." she hesitates, "I've been sending money to a clinic on Europa. They treat miners who can't afford corporate healthcare. It's not an obligation, exactly, but—"
"It's who you are," you finish. "That's not a weakness."
"So between us, about 15,000 

claude: s plus whatever survivor benefits U.E.S. manages to pay out," Chen calculates. "That's maybe three months operating expenses if we're careful. Six if we're desperate."
"The station's supporting us for now," you point out. "But you're right, we need to think long-term."
Yuen adjusts her position, wincing slightly. "There's something else. My medical license is registered through Earth's regulatory board. If Weyland pushes, they could have it suspended pending investigation. That's my whole livelihood."
"My engineering certs are Mars-based," Chen adds. "Harder to revoke, but Weyland has offices there."
"My technical certifications are through the Vexian Trade Collective," you say. "Weyland has no influence there, but it means nothing in human space without corporate sponsorship."
The weight of your vulnerability sits heavy in the room. Three people with modest savings and careers that could be destroyed with a few legal filings.
"We need this case to work," Chen says quietly. "Not just for justice. For survival."
"Or we need to disappear completely," Yuen suggests. "New identities, outer colonies where Weyland has no reach."
"That costs more than 15,000 

claude: s," you note. "Good fake identities that would fool biometric scans? We're talking 50,000 minimum."
The terminal chimes again. This time it's not Kellerman - it's Director Holbrook.
"Preliminary review of Martinez's data is revealing significant evidence. Legal team wants to meet tomorrow at 0800. Also, Mr. Kellerman has formally requested arbitration. I've denied it, but he's escalating to sector authorities. We may have less time than we thought."
Chen looks at the message. "The clock's ticking faster."
What does Dax want to do with the remaining evening?

player: dax wants to reassure them that their obligations back home will be accounted for every step of the way. he wants them to consider what belongs to one, belongs to all - the profit and the debt both (not in those words though, i can't find another way to say it lol). 
he suggests they get some food in their shared quarters and chit-chat over dinner, then head for a good 

claude: "Listen," you say, leaning forward, your lower arms gesturing for emphasis. "Your obligations - Chen's brother, Yuen's clinic - those are our obligations now. We share everything. The profits when we have them, the debts when they come. Three bodies, one fund."
Chen blinks, surprised. "Dax, that's... you barely know us."
"I know enough. We survived hell together. We're choosing to fight together. That means all in." You click your mandibles thoughtfully. "My people, we have a saying - 'The web holds because all strands share the weight.'"
Yuen's eyes soften. "That's either very noble or very naive."
"Maybe both," you admit. "But it's how teams become family."
Chen runs her hand through her hair. "Alright. Three bodies, one fund. But I'm keeping track of every 

claude:  - fair's fair."
"Agreed," Yuen says. "Now, can we please eat? Hospital food was terrible and I'm starving."
You move to the kitchenette, grateful for the normal domesticity of finding food. The diplomatic quarters have a decent selection - actual fresh vegetables, protein that isn't reconstituted, even some Vexian fungi that makes you unexpectedly homesick.
As you prepare dinner together - Chen chopping vegetables with engineering precision, Yuen directing from her chair, you handling multiple tasks with practiced ease - the conversation drifts to lighter things.
"So," Chen asks, stealing a piece of carrot, "how does a Vexian end up on a human crew anyway?"
"Stubbornness," you reply, managing three pans at once. "Told my clutch-mother I wanted to see the galaxy. She said stick to Vexian ships. I signed with U.E.S. the next day."
"Rebel," Chen laughs. "I like it."
Over dinner, you trade stories. Chen's first spacewalk where she forgot to tether and had to be rescued by a very irritated supervisor. Yuen's medical school prank involving anatomically correct jello sculptures. Your first time trying human coffee and being awake for three days straight.
For an hour, you're not survivors or witnesses or targets. You're just three friends sharing a meal.
As you clean up, the terminal shows Kellerman has sent 73 blocked messages.
"New record," Chen observes.
"Let him stew," Yuen yawns. "I need actual sleep. Tomorrow's going to be intense."
You all head to your respective rooms, but leave the connecting doors open - close enough to hear if anyone needs help. It's a small gesture, but it matters.
Roll a Perception check (d20+1) for any nighttime disturbances or dreams.
What do you roll?

player: Perception check: 18 (rolled 

claude: Perception check: 18 (Success!)
Around 0300, your subconscious picks up something - a subtle vibration through the station's hull that doesn't match the normal rhythm of Titan's systems. Your Vexian ancestry makes you sensitive to structural harmonics, and this is... wrong.
Your eyes snap open. Through the open connecting doors, you can hear Chen's steady breathing and Yuen's occasional shift in her bed. But there's something else - a faint scratching sound from the ventilation system.
You silently rise, all four arms moving in practiced quiet as you approach the vent. The scratching stops immediately. Then, barely visible through the grating, you catch a glimpse of something retreating - a small drone, no bigger than your fist.
Surveillance drone. Not station standard - too sleek, too quiet.
You quickly wake the others with gentle touches. Chen comes alert instantly, hand reaching for a weapon that isn't there. Yuen takes a moment longer, still groggy from pain meds.
"Drone in the vents," you whisper. "Someone's watching."
Chen curses quietly. "Kellerman?"
"Or someone working for him," Yuen suggests.
You examine the vent more closely. The grating has micro-scratches around the screws - it's been removed and replaced recently. Professional job, but not perfect.
"They've probably been monitoring us since we got here," you realize. "Maybe heard everything."
"The data log," Chen says, alarmed.
"Already with Holbrook's people," Yuen reminds her. "But they know we had it."
The terminal suddenly lights up with an incoming message - not blocked this time. It's from an unknown sender:
"Impressive detection skills, Mr. Stargazer. Most people never notice our surveillance. Consider this a professional courtesy - Kellerman has hired private contractors. Your 18-hour deadline stands, but the parameters have changed. We have recordings of your conspiracy discussion. Accepting Weyland's offer is no longer optional. - Osprey Security Solutions"
Chen reads it over your shoulder. "Private military contractors. This just escalated."
What does Dax do?

player: dax signals to chen to help him get the grate off and retrieve the surveillance 

claude: You signal to Chen, pointing at the vent with two arms while miming unscrewing with the others. She nods immediately, understanding.
"Yuen, keep watch on the door," you whisper.
Chen grabs a multi-tool from her personal kit - one of the few things she salvaged - while you position yourself to catch whatever's in there. Your four arms give you an advantage for this kind of delicate work.
Rolling Technology check for Dax (d20+3): 16 (Success!)
The screws come out smoothly. You've done this before on the Wanderer, chasing circuit problems through ventilation shafts. As the grate comes free, you spot the drone - it's trying to back away deeper into the vent.
Rolling Dexterity check for Chen (d20+4): 19 (Success!)
Chen's hand shoots into the vent with the speed that comes from years of grabbing tools in zero-g before they float away. "Got it!"
She pulls out a matte black drone, no bigger than a clenched fist. It's still active, a red recording light blinking.
"High-end tech," you observe, examining it with your upper arms while your lower ones hold it steady. "Military grade. This thing costs more than we have in savings combined."
"It's still transmitting," Chen notes, pointing at an indicator light.
"Not for long," you say, finding the main processor with practiced ease. One quick twist and the drone goes dead.
"They know we found it," Yuen says from her position by the door. "That message timing wasn't coincidence."
You crack open the drone's casing. Inside is a memory chip and... something else. A maker's mark. "Osprey Security Solutions. Same group that signed the message."
"Private military contractors doing corporate espionage," Chen says grimly. "This is beyond Kellerman's authority. Someone higher up at Weyland authorized this."
The terminal chimes again. Director Holbrook: "Security alert in your sector. My team is en route. Do not leave your quarters."
Thirty seconds later, Torres and two security officers arrive. She takes one look at the disabled drone in your hands and curses creatively.
"How long?" she asks.
"Could have been hours. Maybe since we arrived," you admit. "I only noticed it at 0300."
Torres activates her comm. "Director, we have a confirmed breach. Osprey Solutions, military-grade surveillance drone in the diplomatic quarters."
Holbrook's voice crackles back: "Lockdown Protocol Nine. No one enters or leaves Section A without my authorization."
Torres turns to you three. "Pack what you need. We're moving you to the secure wing. If Osprey's involved, Kellerman's not playing corporate games anymore. This is something else."
What does Dax do?

player: dax complies fully, packing his things and heading with torres. he asks torres what they can do with the drone to figure out what it knows, where it was sending 

claude: You quickly gather your few possessions - not much survived the Wanderer. As you pack, you hand the disabled drone to Torres.
"Can your people extract data from this? Find out what it recorded, where it was transmitting?"
Torres examines the drone with professional interest. "Our forensics team can try. Osprey's good, but they're not infallible." She bags it carefully. "This is evidence of corporate espionage on a diplomatic station. That's a federal crime."
As you move through the corridors, Chen carrying both her bag and helping steady Yuen, you notice Torres's security detail is larger than before - six officers in full tactical gear.
"Osprey Security," you say to Torres as you walk. "What are we dealing with?"
"Ex-military contractors. They do the work corporations can't officially sanction. Intimidation, extraction, sometimes worse." She glances back at you. "If Weyland hired them, someone very high up is very worried about what you know."
The secure wing is deep in the station's core - no external walls, no vents large enough for drones, one heavily guarded entrance. Your new quarters are smaller but feel safer - a common room with three attached bedrooms, military-grade security systems visible on every surface.
"My forensics team will work on the drone," Torres says. "We might be able to trace the transmission endpoint, see where the data was going. Osprey's tough, but they sometimes get sloppy with their encryption when they think they won't get caught."
Holbrook appears on the secure terminal. "The drone changes things. I'm advancing our timeline. Legal team will meet you at 0600 instead of 0800. We need to file charges before Osprey tries something more direct."
"More direct?" Chen asks.
"Extraction. Kidnapping. Making you disappear." Holbrook's expression is grim. "They've done it before. Never proved, but suspected in twelve cases of missing witnesses."
Roll an Intelligence check (d20+3) to recall anything you might know about Osprey or similar contractors from your time in space.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 19 on a d20 +3 for 

claude: Intelligence check: 22 (Critical Success!)
The name Osprey triggers a cascade of memories - spacer rumors, hushed conversations in stations bars, and one very specific incident.
"Osprey Security Solutions," you say slowly. "They were behind the Ceres Mining whistleblower disappearance three years ago. The pattern's identical - surveillance first, escalating pressure, then the witness vanished during a 'transport malfunction.' They also worked the Proxima bioweapons coverup."
Your lower arms gesture as you recall more details. "They have a signature method - they prefer to make problems disappear legally first. 

claude:  witnesses, find leverage, force compliance. But if that fails within 48 hours, they shift to direct action."
"48 hours?" Yuen asks.
"Corporate attention span," you explain. "After two days, board members start asking questions about expenses. Osprey promises resolution within that window, one way or another."
Torres nods grimly. "That matches our intelligence. You know their founder?"
"Marcus 'Talon' Reeves. Ex-special forces, dishonorably discharged for excessive force during the Europa uprising. Started Osprey with other discharged military." You pause, remembering another detail. "They have a saying: 'Every problem has a price point.' Meaning they'll do anything if paid enough."
Chen pales. "And Weyland has very deep pockets."
"There's something else," you continue, the memory crystallizing. "Osprey always runs two-person cells for witness intimidation. One visible operative making threats, one invisible backup ready for extraction. If they sent that message, there's another operative we haven't seen yet."
Torres immediately activates her comm. "All units, assume two-person Osprey cell on station. Begin sweep for second operative."
"The drone wasn't just surveillance," you realize. "It was marking our location for the extraction team. They know exactly where we were, our sleep patterns, when we're most vulnerable."
Holbrook's image flickers on the screen again. "Mr. Stargazer's intelligence is invaluable. I'm declaring a station-wide security alert. All dock departures frozen for 24 hours."
"That'll trap their extraction team here," Torres observes.
"Or they're already planning to leave another way," you counter. "Osprey sometimes uses maintenance shuttles, emergency pods. Anything not monitored by standard dock control."
The weight of what you're facing settles over the room. This isn't just corporate intimidation anymore - it's professional killers with military training and unlimited resources.
"0600 meeting is in three hours," Yuen says quietly. "Should we try to sleep?"
What does Dax do?
