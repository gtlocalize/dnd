## HISTORICAL CAMPAIGN LOG (Part 3) (Pre-Enhanced Server)
*[Continued from part 2]*

```
The Setting:

The year is 2387, humanity reached the stars about 150 years ago
Still in the Milky Way - no extragalactic travel yet
FTL exists but it's expensive and takes time (days/weeks between systems)
Saturn's moons like Titan are "core worlds" now - safe, established, civilized
The real frontier is beyond the outer planets

Alien Contact:

First Contact happened 87 years ago with the Vexians (your people)
Vexians were already spacefaring when humans met them
About a dozen known sapient species now, mostly peaceful trade relations
No "Federation" - just treaties, trade agreements, and neutral stations like Titan
Some species are older/more advanced, but no one has overwhelming tech superiority

Your People (Vexians):

Come from a low-gravity world with lots of caves/underground cities
Four arms evolved for climbing/navigating complex 3D environments
Naturally good with tech and spatial reasoning
Maybe 2-3% of station population - not rare but not common
Humans still sometimes stare but it's mostly polite curiosity now

Corporate/Political Structure:

Earth has a unified government (United Earth) but it's weak past Mars
Corporations run most things beyond the inner planets
Stations like Titan are "neutral ground" - independent but everyone trades there
Companies like Weyland are megacorps but not quite cyberpunk-level omnipotent
United 

claude: ions Syndicate is small - maybe 50 ships total

That's the basics Dax would know without being a scholar. Ready to continue?

player: (sick ty)dax first pings c-5 and c-9 to see if either of his crewmates are back 

claude: You key in C-5 first. The screen shows "CHEN, M. - CONNECTED"
Chen's face appears immediately, like she was waiting by the terminal. "Dax! Finally! They've had me in this box for twenty minutes already. You okay? What did the Director ask you?"
Before you can answer, she leans closer to the camera and mouths silently: "Still have it." She taps her chest - Martinez's data log.
You toggle to C-9. "YUEN, S. - NO RESPONSE"
Makes sense - she's probably still in medical treatment, sedated for the rib work.
Chen's voice comes through again: "Dax, I've been thinking. That Weyland rep who showed up during your debrief? They were awfully quick to get here. Like they were waiting for us."
She's right. The Wanderer only docked maybe an hour ago, but Weyland already had insurance claims filed and a representative demanding access to survivors.
The comms terminal blinks again - J.PARK's message is still waiting.
Chen adds: "Oh, and our U.E.S. rep already messaged me. Jonathan Park. Sounds... nervous. Really nervous."
What does Dax do?

player: "i'm glad you're safe, chen. really i am. we'll talk when the time is right." dax cuts the call. he hopes his nerves about talking too much over surveillance are picked up by chen, lest she just thinks he's being cold. she's too worked up, too prone to spoiling something.
dax turns to the message from 

claude: Chen's expression flickers with hurt confusion before the screen cuts. You'll need to make that right later, but she's too hot right now, too ready to spill everything over monitored comms.
You open Park's message. It's text only, carefully formatted:

TO: D. Stargazer
FROM: J. Park, United 

claude: ions Syndicate (Titan Station Office)
SUBJECT: Condolences and Administrative Matters
Mr. Stargazer,
First, my deepest condolences on the loss of the U.E.S. Wanderer and her crew. Captain Morrison was a valued member of the U.E.S. family.
I have been informed of your survival along with Engineer Chen and Dr. Yuen. This is... unexpected but welcome news.
There are several administrative matters requiring attention:

Survivor benefits paperwork
Standard incident debriefing for U.E.S. records
Coordination with insurance investigators
Next-of-kin notifications for deceased crew

I understand you are in mandatory quarantine for 48 hours. I will visit as soon as permitted. In the meantime, Weyland Biosystems has requested copies of all crew logs and records. As your U.E.S. representative, I must advise you that you are NOT obligated to provide these without legal counsel present.
Please rest and recover. We will handle the formalities when you are ready.
Regards,
Jonathan Park
Senior Administrator (Titan Station)
United 

claude: ions Syndicate
P.S. - The main office has asked me to determine if any backup data cores were recovered. Standard procedure would have been to eject them before abandoning ship. Please advise at your earliest convenience.

That postscript is interesting. Is he fishing for evidence, or hinting that you should have some?
What does Dax do?

player: dax is annoyed with himself. the backups. it wasn't his fault, the memory blocker was still active while he was on the bridge. the captain never mentioned it either, but... he was in no state to think corporate.dax heads to a mirror, splashes his face and begins to practice his spiel for the debrief. largely the same information he went over with the director, but with more detail about the captain and the other crew they saw while there.
he considers how much he should say about weyland, but remembers the conversation will be being watched. he'll need to articulate so he's not lying, and so that he can fill in the gaps about weyland later.he also considers survivor benefits. this is no time to take a corp apartment on titan and rest up. he needs to get back out there - this is no mystery that'll be solved on titan alone. he wonders if the benefits could get him a modest ship instead. he could take on small shipping requests to make some cash while focusing on his true mission. on... their true mission? would chen and yuen join him, he thinks to himself. chen would make a great captain. a doctor would be very useful 

claude: The mirror shows a tired Vexian face - your mandibles slightly drooped, your compound eyes dulled from stress. The cold water helps, though it's strange on your chitinous features compared to human skin.
You run through the story again, rehearsing. Morrison's heroism. The crew you couldn't save. The "artifacts" with no further detail. The quarantine he maintained. Each word carefully true but incomplete. You can fill the gaps later when you're not being recorded by who-knows-how-many parties.
The survivor benefits... standard U.E.S. package would be:

Three months salary continuation
Trauma counseling (which you'll definitely refuse)
Temporary housing on any U.E.S.-affiliated station
OR a lump sum of about 15,000 Universal 

claude: s

That lump sum... it's not enough for a ship. Not even close. Even a rusty single-berth courier would run 50,000 minimum. But if Chen and Yuen pooled their benefits too - 45,000 

claude: s. Add in whatever savings you each have...
You think about Chen. She'd spent three years on the Wanderer, worked her way up from junior engineer. She's got the temperament for command when she's not running hot. And she's already proven she can handle herself in crisis.
Dr. Yuen... she knows more than she's said. That comment about you asking her to place the memory lock - that suggests you trusted her three weeks ago with dangerous knowledge. A ship's doctor who can keep secrets might be invaluable.
But would they follow you on what might be a revenge quest disguised as justice?
The comms terminal chimes. New message from C-5 (Chen): "Dax, I get it. Wrong time. But we need to sync our stories before official debrief. 47 hours to get it right."
She got your message about surveillance. Smart.
What does Dax do?

player: dax goes over what he'd practiced in the mirror, making sure to earnestly fill in bits he'd forgotten with chen's knowledge of events. to anyone listening in, it wouldn't sound like conspiracy, just two survivors helping each others memories.
the gaps regarding weyland are, hopefully, picked up on by chen as being intentional, and are left as mysteries for 

claude: You open the comm to Chen, keeping your voice steady and professional. "Chen, you're right. We should go over the timeline. Make sure we have everything straight."
"Yeah," she says, catching your tone immediately. "Let's start from when you woke up in Medical."
You methodically walk through the events. The cryo-pod malfunction. The damaged ship. Finding the logs about an "unidentified biological signature in the cargo bay." You describe the Skitterers in detail, the infected crew, the amalgamation creature.
"The Captain mentioned he'd acquired some artifacts for transport," you say carefully. "But he never told us the specifics. Just cargo, as far as we knew."
Chen nods slowly on screen. "Right. Morrison handled all acquisitions. We just... transported things." Her voice is perfectly neutral. She's caught on.
You continue through the story - Rostova's sacrifice, the armory code 7355, the plasma injector repair, Morrison's final stand.
"The cargo bay was covered in that organic residue," Chen adds. "Whatever was in those containers, it got out. Poor containment? Damaged in transit? Who knows."
"Who knows," you agree.
You both carefully review each crew member you encountered, living and dead. The story is complete, consistent, and thoroughly missing any mention of your recovered memories or Martinez's data log.
"I think we have it straight," Chen finally says. "Same story for the U.E.S. debrief tomorrow."
"Agreed. Get some rest, Chen."
She gives you a long look through the screen. "You too, Dax. We're going to need our strength for whatever comes next."
The call ends. Your story is synchronized. The official version, anyway.
What does Dax do?

player: dax is exhausted. but there's something left on his mind. who was handling cargo on the ship? he'd been by to help with some checks and repairs, sure, but he wasn't a cargo worker.
he looks around for something that might help him investigate, one more piece of the puzzle before he turns 

claude: You pace the small quarters, your mind churning. The cargo manifests. Someone had to handle the physical loading, sign off on the containers, supervise the storage...
The room's comm terminal has basic station directory access. You search for U.E.S. Wanderer crew records - they're part of the incident report, technically public within the investigation.
The manifest appears:

Captain Morrison - commanded acquisitions
Cargo Chief Ramirez - killed first, Chen mentioned
Loading Supervisor Martinez - Chen has his data log
Cargo Specialist Yuen, D. -

Wait. Yuen, D.
Not ship's doctor. Dr. Yuen was listed as Cargo Specialist with medical certification. She'd have been responsible for biological cargo, anything requiring special environmental controls. She'd have signed off on those containers.
Your memory flashes - three weeks ago, going to her about the suspicious manifests. She'd helped you, yes, but she'd also have been the one who cleared those "artifacts" for storage in the first place.
Another piece clicks. Her insistence in the Med Bay about telling you the memory lock code, even while injured and low on oxygen. Her knowledge that the Captain was tricked. She knew because she'd have been part of the acquisition process.
The terminal blinks with another update - Dr. Yuen's status has changed to "Conscious - Restricted Communication per Medical Protocol."
She's awake. And she has a lot more to explain than just your memory lock.
You're exhausted, running on fumes, but this revelation sits heavy in your mind.
What does Dax do?

player: dax wants nothing more than to keep digging, keep asking questions. but nothing he can ask yuen right now would be anything they want being overheard. 
he sends her a message hoping she's well, wishing her a good night and assuring her that they'll talk first thing in the morning.
dax performs whatever night routine vexians perform and goes to 

claude: You send a brief message to Dr. Yuen: "Glad you're recovering. Rest well. We'll speak in the morning."
The quarters' lights dim automatically as you move toward the bed, adjusting to Vexian preferences - softer, more amber than the harsh white humans prefer.
You perform your evening khett-sa, the 

claude: ative stretching routine your people developed in the low-gravity caverns of home. Each of your four arms extends in sequence, chitinous joints clicking softly as you work out the tension of the last few days. It's the first time you've had space and privacy for the ritual since before... everything.
You clean your mandibles with the provided hygiene kit (thankfully, Titan Station stocks multi-species supplies), and run a damp cloth over your compound eyes - they've been dry and irritated from all the recycled ship air and smoke.
The bed is surprisingly comfortable, with adjustments for various anatomies. You arrange yourself in the Vexian sleeping position - lower arms folded beneath you, upper arms free (an evolutionary holdover from when your ancestors needed to be ready to catch themselves if they fell from cave walls during sleep).
As exhaustion finally claims you, your mind churns with questions. Yuen's cargo role. Martinez's data. Weyland's timing. The Director's careful probing. But for now, for just a few hours, you need rest.
Tomorrow will bring the official debriefs. And somehow, you need to navigate them without revealing what you know, while figuring out who you can actually trust.
Sleep takes you, deep and dreamless.

[Shall we continue with the next morning, or would you like to save here?]

player: (let's save and readjust the artefact!)
ooc question, what species' are chen and yuen? i think dax called one of them human earlier but that might just have been me assuming. dax probably wouldn't know their back stories ( maybe yuen, but he doesn't quite remember), but he can see them 

claude: (OOC: Good question! I actually haven't specified their species - let me establish that now:
Chen is human - fairly typical spacer stock, probably from one of the asteroid colonies based on her engineering background. Dark hair, compact build from growing up in artificial gravity, maybe early 30s.
Dr. Yuen is also human, but likely from one of the core worlds given her medical training and dual specialization. More polished than typical frontier crew. Maybe late 30s, early 40s.
Humans still make up about 60-70% of most crews since human companies like U.E.S. tend to hire their own species preferentially (not policy, just unconscious bias). Dax being Vexian made him a bit of an outsider on the crew, though his technical skills spoke for themselves.
You're right that Dax wouldn't know their full backstories yet, especially with the memory lock having been in place. He'd know Chen has been on the ship for 3 years and worked her way up. Yuen... well, he's just discovering she wasn't quite what she seemed.
Good catch on me being vague about this - it's important to know who your allies actually are!
Let me update the artifact's campaign notes to reflect where we are in the story...)D&D Solo Campaign CompanionInteractive artifact ∙ Version 33 Updated! The artifact now has the current story state saved. We're paused at:

End of Day 1 in quarantine
Dax has discovered Dr. Yuen was the cargo specialist
Stories are synchronized with Chen
Everyone's resting for tomorrow's official debrief
47 hours of quarantine remaining

This is a great stopping point. When we continue, it'll be the morning with the U.E.S. debrief looming and Dax needing to carefully navigate the political waters while figuring out if he can trust Yuen with what she knows.
Save the artifact and you can pick this up anytime! The campaign notes have everything needed to continue the story.

player: one piece of feedback - i don't think we had a single roll during day 1 lol. let's not just have rolls for action - stuff like dax looking for weyland influence, chen picking up on the surveillance vibes. i'll often  nudge as well by saying like "dax tries to", "attempts to", "hopes that" 

claude: You're absolutely right! Day 1 was way too smooth - I should have been calling for rolls during the investigation and social moments. Good catches on where rolls should have happened:

Dax examining the station for Weyland influence: Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation)
Chen picking up surveillance hints: Wisdom (Insight)
Dax trying to stay calm with the Director: We did roll that one at least!
Maybe even Dax recognizing Yuen's cargo role: Intelligence (Investigation)

I'll be much better about calling for rolls during non-combat scenes. Social encounters, investigation, noticing details, trying to deceive or persuade - all need rolls to add tension and uncertainty. The dice should be part of the storytelling, not just the action scenes.
And yes, I'll watch for those verbal cues - "tries to," "attempts to," "hopes that" are all perfect indicators that you want to roll for something.
Thanks for the feedback! When we pick up with Day 2, expect a lot more skill checks as Dax navigates the political minefield of debriefs and investigations. Those Charisma rolls are going to be rough with his +0 modifier...
Ready to continue whenever you are! The morning debrief with the nervous Mr. Park should definitely involve some rolls to see what Dax can learn (or hide).

player: also i'm a noob when it comes to this kinda thing, but is training a thing? like to bring the str -1 to a 0 or get +1 in cha? does it happen naturally over time? or is it locked tf in? whatever's 'the norm' is good for 

claude: In D&D 5e (which we're loosely using), stats are usually locked in at character creation. BUT! There are a few common ways DMs handle improvement:
Standard Options:

Ability Score Improvements (ASI) - Every 4 levels, you can add +2 to one stat or +1 to two stats (can't go above 20)
Feats - Sometimes instead of ASI, you can take a feat that might give +1 to a stat plus other benefits
Magic items - Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Headband of Intellect, etc.

Training (Optional Rule):
Some DMs allow downtime training - like spending weeks/months and 

claude: s to improve a weak stat by 1. Makes narrative sense that Dax could hit the gym during long space flights to get that STR from -1 to 0.
My Suggestion for Our Game:

Every 2-3 "chapters" (major story arcs), you get an ASI
Training during downtime costs 

claude: s and time (like 30 days and 1000 

claude: s to raise a stat by 1, max once per stat)
Story moments might grant improvements (like if you do lots of diplomacy, maybe earn +1 CHA)

So yeah, Dax could eventually get less terrible at strength or more charismatic, but it'll take time and effort. Sound good? We can keep it flexible and story-driven rather than strict XP tracking.
What feels right for the campaign to you?

player: yeah that sounds good to me bossmanlet's go day 

claude: DAY 2 - TITAN STATION QUARANTINE
You wake to the soft chime of the quarters' alarm. 0700 station time. Your compound eyes adjust to the rising lights, taking in Saturn's pale gold through the viewport.
Your body feels better - the first real rest you've had in days. The khett-sa stretches helped, though your lower left arm is sore from all that ladder climbing on the Wanderer.
The comm terminal shows:

3 new messages from J. Park
1 message from Dr. Yuen
System Notice: Debrief scheduled 0900 with U.E.S. Representative

Dr. Yuen's message is simple: "We need to talk. Before the debrief. Please."
Park's messages are increasingly nervous reminders about documentation, procedures, and "the importance of accurate record-keeping."
The beverage dispenser hums invitingly. The Vexian equivalent of coffee - a warm, slightly acidic brew from your homeworld - might help clear your head.
You have two hours before the official debrief. Time to figure out if you can trust Dr. Yuen with what you know, or if she's been playing you from the start.
Roll a Wisdom (Insight) check (d20 + 1) to see if you can read between the lines of Yuen's message - is her urgency desperation or manipulation?
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 17 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Wisdom (Insight) check: 18 (Success!)
Reading the message again, you parse the subtext. The punctuation, the timing, the simple directness - this isn't manipulation. This is someone who's been carrying guilt and needs to confess before they lose their nerve.
She sent it at 0400 station time. She's been awake all night wrestling with this.
The "Before the debrief" is key - she wants to come clean to you before the official story gets locked in. Someone planning to manipulate you would wait until after, see what you say officially first.
You grab your Vexian coffee - bitter and sharp, perfect for cutting through the morning fog - and open a comm to C-9.
Dr. Yuen appears on screen immediately. She looks exhausted despite the medical treatment, dark circles under her eyes. The regenerative gel has closed her wounds, but her expression shows a different kind of pain.
"Dax," she starts, then stops. Swallows. "I know you've figured it out. Cargo Specialist. I... I signed off on those containers. The manifests said archaeological specimens. Inert biological samples. Morrison trusted my assessment."
She's not looking at the camera, staring at something off-screen.
"Three weeks ago, when you came to me with your suspicions, I should have admitted it then. But I was scared. Scared I'd been fooled. Scared I'd killed us all through incompetence." Her voice cracks slightly. "Then you asked me to help with the memory lock, and I thought... maybe if we could prove Weyland lied, it wouldn't be my fault."
She finally looks directly at you. "I need you to know everything before Park gets here. Before we're on record."
What does Dax do?

player: dax is frustrated, disappointed. he'd be angry if he had the capacity for it - he was never one to succumb to a base instinct like rage. yuen has spilled it all, with god-knows-who listening.
he doesn't blame her for her part in bringing those things onto the ship. but her desperation has shown their hand, and now he and chen look like liars from their conversation the day before.
... unless... surprise... he has to act surprised. like he didn't know any of this. chen will get it, she always does.
dax thanks yuen for plugging the gaps in information. he suggests they bring chen in on this call, so she can learn this "new" context 

claude: Your mandibles tighten - the Vexian equivalent of a clenched jaw - as you process what just happened. Yuen just confessed to signing off on the cargo over monitored comms. Whoever's listening now knows you and Chen held back information yesterday.
But you force surprise into your voice, playing the only card you have: "You... you signed off on them? Dr. Yuen, I had no idea you were cargo specialist. This changes..." you pause, as if processing. "This changes everything. Chen needs to hear this."
You can see Yuen's confusion at your formal tone, but you push forward, adding Chen to the call.
Chen's face appears, still groggy. "What's going—"
"Chen, Dr. Yuen just informed me she was actually the cargo specialist. She signed off on those containers." You put just enough shock in your voice for the recording.
Chen's eyes sharpen instantly, reading the situation. "What? Doc, you were... but you never said anything on the ship."
"I know," Yuen says miserably. "I was scared. When everything went wrong, I—"
"You should have told us immediately," Chen cuts in, playing her part perfectly. "We've been trying to piece together what happened, and you had critical information this whole time?"
Roll a Deception check (d20 + 0 with your Charisma) to see if your surprised act is convincing enough for whoever's monitoring this call.
What do you roll?

player: fuck lol, I rolled 8 on a 

claude: Deception check: 8 (Failure)
Your acting is stiff, unconvincing. The surprise in your voice sounds hollow even to your own ears - like someone reading from a script they just received.
There's a long pause. Then Yuen's expression changes. Not confusion anymore, but a dawning realization.
"You... you already knew," she says quietly. "Both of you knew."
Chen drops the act immediately. "Doc—"
"No, I get it," Yuen interrupts. "Monitored comms. You were protecting the information. And I just..." She puts her head in her hands. "I just blew it all over an open channel."
The damage is done. Whoever's listening - Weyland, the Director, station security - now knows:

Yuen was responsible for clearing the cargo
You and Chen discovered this information but hid it
You're actively coordinating your stories

A notification pops up on your screen: "Director Holbrook requests your presence. Escort arriving in 5 minutes."
Chen curses. "So much for waiting until 0900."
Yuen looks devastated. "Dax, I'm sorry. I thought... I thought being honest would help. I didn't think about—"
"We adapt," you cut in. No point in recriminations now. "Chen, stick to the story we discussed but be ready to adjust. Yuen, tell them everything about the cargo, but nothing about the memory lock unless directly asked."
The door chime sounds. Your escort is here.
The game has changed. Time to face the Director with your cards partially revealed.
What does Dax do?

player: dax knows the only hand he has left is befriending the director. he's expecting her to be quite angry at this turn of events, but he has to do what he can to win her over. from what he's gleamed from this station so far, she has the power to continue shielding them from weyland and maybe even help... if it's in her 

claude: The security officers are polite but firm. "Mr. Stargazer, the Director requests your immediate presence."
As you walk through the station corridors, you notice more activity than yesterday. Workers pause to stare - word of the Wanderer survivors has spread. You catch whispers: "...only three survived..." "...some kind of infection..." "...Weyland's furious..."
The Director's office is high in the station's central spire. Floor-to-ceiling windows show Saturn's rings in breathtaking detail. Holbrook stands with her back to you, hands clasped behind her.
"Mr. Stargazer. Please sit."
She turns, and her expression isn't angry - it's calculating.
"That was quite the performance this morning. Unfortunately for you, I've been running this station for twelve years. I know bad acting when I hear it."
She sits across from you, placing a tablet on the desk between you. On it, a waveform analysis of your conversation.
"Your stress patterns spiked when Dr. Yuen started talking. Chen's response time was too quick - she was ready for the revelation. You've been coordinating."
She leans back. "Here's what I know: Three survivors from an impossible situation. One turns out to be the cargo specialist who approved the containers. You two knew this but tried to hide it. Why?"
Her eyes are sharp. "I have Weyland breathing down my neck, demanding access to you. I have U.E.S. sending increasingly panicked messages. And I have three survivors who are clearly hiding something bigger than procedural failures."
She stands, moving to the window. "I don't like Weyland, Mr. Stargazer. They throw their weight around, assume 

claude: s buy authority on my station. But I need more than dislike to protect you. I need the truth."
Roll a Wisdom (Insight) check (d20 + 1) to gauge if she's genuinely willing to help or just fishing for information.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 18 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Wisdom (Insight) check: 19 (Success!)
You study her body language, the micro-expressions that even experienced politicians can't fully hide. The way she said "I don't like Weyland" - there was genuine distaste there, maybe even history. The tension in her shoulders when she mentioned them breathing down her neck.
But more telling is what she's not doing. She hasn't called in Weyland's rep. She brought you here alone, no security recording, no legal witnesses. She's giving you a chance to come clean in private.
And that comment about "twelve years running this station" - there's pride there. This is her station. Weyland is just a tenant, and an annoying one at that.
She's fishing for information, yes, but she's also genuinely willing to help if you give her ammunition to work with. She needs something concrete to justify protecting you from Weyland. She's a political creature, but not a corporate puppet.
"Director," you begin carefully, "hypothetically... if someone had evidence that Weyland deliberately misrepresented dangerous biological weapons as archaeological specimens, resulting in the deaths of twenty-three people... what would that be worth?"
She turns from the window slowly, her expression sharp as a blade.
"Hypothetically? That would be worth quite a lot, Mr. Stargazer. Corporate fraud resulting in mass casualties? That would give me grounds to freeze all Weyland operations on this station pending investigation." A thin smile. "They wouldn't be able to touch you or your crew during such an investigation. Might take months. Years, even."
She sits back down, leaning forward. "But I would need proof. Real, concrete evidence. Not suspicions or recovered memories."
What does Dax do?

player: dax spills it all. everything he knows. including the datapad chen hid, the last piece of physical evidence they have. he suggests she (or at least the datapad) be brought here for them to look into. he also explains he made several scans with his med scanner, wherever they're holding 

claude: You take a breath and make the gamble. Everything on the table.
"Three weeks before the incident, I scanned unusual manifest discrepancies. The 'archaeological specimens' had Weyland Biosystems manufacturing tags embedded in their shipping codes. Black market bioweapon indicators. I confronted Morrison - he was genuinely shocked. He'd been sold these as legitimate artifacts."
Holbrook's expression doesn't change, but she's listening intently.
"I went to Dr. Yuen to verify my findings. We planned to document everything, but I was paranoid about corporate retaliation. I had Yuen place a memory lock on me - insurance in case something went wrong. The code was 5-5-3-7, my employee ID reversed."
You continue, "When everything went to hell, I recovered those memories during our escape. But that's just my word. However..." you lean forward, "Chen has Martinez's data log hidden on her person. Martinez was tracking creature movements, documenting the outbreak. And my medical scanner has biological scans of three different organism types - the Skitterers, the infected, and the amalgam creature. All clearly engineered."
"The scanner should have cached data proving these weren't natural organisms. Bioweapon signatures would be unmistakable."
Holbrook reaches for her comm. "Bring Engineer Chen to my office immediately. And retrieve the medical scanner from quarantine storage."
She looks back at you. "If this evidence is what you claim, Mr. Stargazer, then Weyland committed an act of corporate terrorism. That's not just criminal - on a neutral station, that's grounds for complete asset seizure and arrest of all corporate officers."
She pauses. "You understand what you're starting? Weyland won't go down quietly. They have resources, lawyers, private security. They might come after you."
"They already killed my crew," you reply simply.
Roll a Persuasion check (d20 + 0) to see if your honesty and evidence convince Holbrook to fully commit to protecting you and pursuing Weyland.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 20 on a d20 - NAT 

claude: Persuasion check: NATURAL 20! (Critical Success!)
The room goes silent except for the hum of the station's life support. Holbrook stares at you for a long moment, then something shifts in her expression. Decision crystallizing into action.
She stands and walks to a wall panel, pressing her palm against it. A hidden compartment opens, revealing a secure terminal.
"Computer, activate Protocol Seven. Director's Override. All Weyland Biosystems assets on Titan Station are hereby frozen pending investigation of corporate terrorism charges. Security teams to Weyland offices immediately. No communications in or out."
She turns back to you. "Done. As of this moment, you and your crew are under my personal protection as material witnesses in a capital case."
The door chimes. Chen enters, escorted by security, looking worried. "Director, what—"
"Your data log, Engineer. Now."
Chen hesitates, then pulls Martinez's log from an inner pocket. Holbrook slots it into her terminal immediately. Data streams across the screen - timestamps, biological readings, Martinez's voice notes documenting the spreading infection.
"God in heaven," Holbrook breathes. "This is... this is damning."
Another chime. A technician enters with your medical scanner. Holbrook activates it herself, scrolling through the cached scans. The Skitterer's bio-signature, clearly showing engineered markers. The infected crew, with fungal patterns matching known weapon strains. The amalgam creature, a nightmare of directed mutation.
She looks up at both of you. "This isn't just evidence. This is proof of 

claude: ated mass murder."
Her comm buzzes. "Director, Weyland's office is... resisting. Mr. Kellerman is demanding to speak with you."
"Tell Mr. Kellerman he can speak to me after his arrest. Charge him with obstruction if he continues to resist."
She turns back to you. "You've given me everything I need to bury them, but they'll fight back. They'll claim the evidence is fabricated, that you're disgruntled survivors looking for someone to blame. We need more."
"The memory lock," she muses. "If we could get a neural scan showing the tampered memories, proving you hid this information before the incident..."
She smiles, and it's sharp as a blade. "Mr. Stargazer, how would you like to help me destroy Weyland Biosystems?"
What does Dax do?

player: "with pleasure", he replies, "whatever it takes."
he probes for improved hospitalities - secure rooms where he can communicate with chen and yuen in private. as a sign of their mutual trust, he's fine with standard station security surveillance, the kind that the director and/or her sec teams would likely have on all on-station comms. he just doesn't want others listening in any more.
otherwise, he waits to hear what the director has in mind for them.
... them... yuen's not 

claude: "With pleasure," you reply. "Whatever it takes."
"First things first," you continue. "We need secure quarters where my crew can actually communicate. I understand station security needs to monitor us - that's fine, I trust your people. But no more corporate ears, no more wondering who else is listening."
Holbrook nods. "Done. I'll move you to Section A - diplomatic quarters. My security team monitors those directly, no external feeds. You'll have privacy from everyone except my most trusted staff."
Chen shifts uncomfortably. "Director, Dr. Yuen isn't here. She needs to know what's happening."
"She's being briefed now," Holbrook replies. "My medical chief is with her. She'll be moved to join you once she's stable enough."
The Director pulls up a holographic display of the station. "Here's what I need from you. Weyland's local operations are frozen, but their corporate headquarters on Europa will respond within 48 hours. They'll send lawyers, private security, maybe worse. Before that happens, we need to build an airtight case."
She highlights several locations on the map. "First, we need that neural scan of your memory lock - my medical team can do that. Second, I want you to work with my investigators to create a complete timeline. Every detail, every crew member, every piece of evidence."
"But here's the real play," she leans forward. "Kellerman doesn't know you've talked to me yet. He thinks you're still in quarantine, still accessible. I want to let him think that. When he reaches out - and he will - you record everything. Let him incriminate himself."
Chen grins darkly. "You want us to be bait."
"I want you to be justice," Holbrook corrects. "Twenty-three people are dead. Someone at Weyland made that decision. I want to know who."
A thought occurs to you. "Director, the Wanderer's black box. Emergency data core. It would have automatically ejected before the ship was lost. If we could retrieve it..."
Her eyes sharpen. "That would have everything. Logs, communications, sensor data. Where would it be?"
"Still floating near Saturn's rings, broadcasting a retrieval signal. But Weyland will be looking for it too."
Roll an Intelligence check (d20 + 3) to remember the specific emergency protocols and estimate the black box's current location.
What do you roll?

player: balls, I rolled 2 on a d20 +3 for 

claude: Intelligence check: 5 (Critical Failure)
Your mind goes completely blank. The emergency procedures, the ejection protocols, the orbital mechanics - it all turns to static in your head. The stress of the past few days, the memory lock, the lack of sleep - it all crashes down at once.
"I... I can't remember," you admit, frustrated. "The black box would have ejected when Morrison initiated final protocols, but the trajectory..." You rub your compound eyes with one hand. "It's gone. I can't calculate it."
Chen steps in. "Standard protocol is ejection perpendicular to ship's trajectory. The Wanderer was in Saturn's orbit, so—"
"That's a search area of millions of cubic kilometers," Holbrook interrupts. "Without precise calculations, it could take weeks to find. And Weyland probably has the ship's last telemetry data from their insurance claim."
She thinks for a moment. "We'll have to work with what we have. The evidence here is strong, but that black box would be the killing blow." She taps her terminal. "I'll dispatch a recovery team to search, but don't count on it."
A notification appears on her screen. "Speaking of Weyland, Mr. Kellerman is demanding his comm access be restored. He wants to speak with the survivors." She looks at you. "Ready to play bait? Remember, he doesn't know you've given me the evidence yet."
"Director," Chen says, "what about Park? Our U.E.S. rep? He's supposed to debrief us this morning."
"Mr. Park can wait. This takes priority." Holbrook stands. "I'll have you moved to Section A within the hour. Get some rest, then we'll set up the call with Kellerman. Make him think you're still scared, isolated survivors. Let him make his threats or his bribes."
She pauses at the door. "Oh, and Mr. Stargazer? That memory of yours better come back. We might need those calculations yet."
What does Dax do?

player: dax's frustration boils over. he knows he knows where the black box would be, but it's all just been too much.
he also knows he's no actor. he asks chen how confident she is that she can hoodwink kellerman, hoping she might be able to take the lead. but she's an engineer, not an entertainer... they might have to struggle through this 

claude: Your four fists clench in frustration. "I KNOW this information. Morrison drilled emergency procedures into everyone. But it's just... gone." You slam one hand on the table, making Chen jump.
"Easy, Dax," she says. "We've been through hell. Your brain's probably protecting you from—"
"My brain is failing when we need it most," you cut her off, then immediately regret your tone. "Sorry. I just..."
Chen waves it off. "Look, about Kellerman - I'm an engineer, not a con artist. I can try to lead, but..." she grimaces. "Remember when I tried to bluff those inspectors about the coolant leak last year? Morrison had to step in before I got us all fined."
You manage a weak laugh despite everything. "You told them it was 'supposed to be that color.'"
"Green coolant in a system that uses blue. Yeah, not my finest moment." She sobers. "But we don't have a choice. We have to try."
"Together then," you say. "Play up the trauma. We're scared survivors who just want this over with."
Chen nods. "I can do scared. Hell, I don't even have to act for that part."
The door opens. Dr. Yuen enters in a wheelchair, pushed by a medical technician. She looks pale but determined.
"I heard everything," she says quietly. "Holbrook briefed me. I want to help with Kellerman." She meets your eyes. "I owe you both that much. I'm the one who signed those containers. Let me take some of the heat."
Roll an Insight check (d20 + 1) to gauge if Yuen is stable enough to handle a confrontation with Kellerman.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 17 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Insight check: 18 (Success!)
Looking at Dr. Yuen, you see past the wheelchair and the medical monitors. Her hands are steady. Her breathing is controlled despite the pain medication. Most importantly, her eyes have a clarity that wasn't there this morning - the confusion and guilt have crystallized into determination.
She's not just stable; she's focused. The guilt is driving her, but not clouding her judgment. If anything, she might be your best asset here - Kellerman won't expect the "guilty" cargo specialist to be working against him.
"You're ready," you tell her. "But we need a plan. Kellerman will try to divide us, use your guilt against you."
"Let him," Yuen says firmly. "I did sign those containers. That part's true. But I was deceived, and I have the certification logs to prove the containers were sealed and labeled as inert specimens. The fraud was on Weyland's end."
Chen nods. "So we stick to partial truths. We're scared, we want this over, but we don't volunteer anything."
Director Holbrook re-enters. "Your new quarters are ready. Section A, diplomatic wing. My personal security chief, Commander Torres, will oversee your protection. She's... thorough."
She hands you a secure comm unit. "This links directly to my office. Use it if Kellerman crosses any lines. And remember - he's going to try to isolate you, make individual deals. Don't let him."
The three of you are escorted to Section A. The difference is immediate - real windows, a common area where you can meet, individual rooms that connect. It feels less like a prison and more like a safe house.
An hour later, the comm terminal chimes.
"Mr. Kellerman, Weyland Biosystems, requesting communication with survivors of U.E.S. Wanderer."
Chen looks at you. "Showtime."
What does Dax do?

player: dax gives a final comment, reassuring but reminding the truth is only for the director, and allows kellerman 

claude: "Remember," you say quietly, "we're scared survivors who want this over. The truth about Weyland is only for the Director. Nothing about memory locks, nothing about what we knew before."
Chen and Yuen nod. You accept the call.
The screen fills with a man in an expensive suit - mid-40s, sharp features, predator's smile. Behind him, a pristine office with Weyland's logo prominent.
"Survivors of the Wanderer," Kellerman begins, voice smooth as oil. "I'm James Kellerman, Senior Liaison for Weyland Biosystems. First, let me express our deepest condolences for your ordeal and the loss of your colleagues."
He doesn't wait for a response. "I understand there's been some confusion about the cargo we contracted with Captain Morrison. Very tragic how improper handling led to such catastrophic results."
The accusation hangs there, baited hook.
Dr. Yuen shifts in her wheelchair. Chen's jaw tightens.
"We're reviewing the incident for our insurance claim," Kellerman continues. "However, we've noticed some... discrepancies in your initial statements to Station Security. Different versions of events. Memory gaps." His eyes find you specifically. "Mr. Stargazer, your medical scan showed neurological anomalies. That must be concerning."
He leans forward. "Weyland values truth. We're prepared to offer substantial compensation - enough to set you up for life - in exchange for accurate testimony about Captain Morrison's negligence in handling our legitimate archaeological specimens."
Roll an Insight check (d20 + 1) to read between the lines of his offer and threat.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 10 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Insight check: 11 (Partial Success)
You catch the surface-level threat clearly enough - he knows about your memory anomaly and he's dangling money versus the implied threat of using your "unreliable" testimony against you. But there's something else underneath his smooth delivery that you can't quite parse.
The compensation offer is obvious bribery. The threat about "discrepancies" is meant to make you doubt yourselves. But why is he so confident? He's acting like he holds cards you don't know about.
Chen speaks first, voice carefully controlled. "Mr. Kellerman, we've been through severe trauma. Of course our initial statements might have gaps. We watched our friends die."
"Of course, of course," Kellerman says smoothly. "Trauma can affect memory. Make people... misremember things. Even believe things that didn't happen. Expert witnesses would testify to that."
There it is - he'd paint you as delusional if needed.
Dr. Yuen leans forward slightly. "I signed off on those containers personally, Mr. Kellerman. They were sealed and labeled as inert archaeological specimens. My certification logs show that clearly."
His smile doesn't waver. "Dr. Yuen, your recent medical trauma is concerning. Head injuries, blood loss, oxygen deprivation - all can affect recall. And your... personal relationship with the deceased Captain might cloud your judgment about his actions."
Personal relationship? You and Chen exchange glances. Was there something between Yuen and Morrison?
"What exactly are you offering?" you ask, keeping your voice neutral.
"250,000 

claude: s. Each. Plus passage to any system you choose. All medical expenses covered. In exchange for truthful testimony that acknowledges the captain's failure to follow proper containment protocols."
What does Dax do?

player: dax starts a much less detailed recollection of events than he's given previously. he leans into painting the captain as a hero. he also looks over to yuen at key moments, hoping she can take over the narrative - she seems much better at this than him and 

claude: You begin slowly, carefully. "Captain Morrison maintained quarantine protocols even as he was dying. He could have opened the escape pods immediately, saved himself, but he knew the risk to the station."
You look at Yuen, catching her eye. She picks up smoothly.
"Mr. Kellerman, I worked with Captain Morrison for two years," she says, her voice steady. "He was meticulous about procedures. When those containers arrived, every seal was intact. Every documentation code checked out. The manifests said archaeological specimens from site LV-426. Inert. Safe."
Kellerman's smile tightens slightly. "Documentation can be misread, Dr. Yuen."
"Not by Morrison," Chen jumps in, finding her confidence. "I watched him spend three hours once verifying a single shipping code because one digit looked off. If those containers had shown any sign of biological hazard, he would have spaced them immediately."
You continue your simplified account - the creatures, the infection, the crew's desperate fight. You leave out anything about your prior knowledge, the memory lock, Martinez's detailed logs. Just scared survivors remembering a nightmare.
"The captain's final words," you say, letting real emotion creep in, "were to tell everyone what happened. To make sure no one else suffered like our crew did."
Kellerman's expression shifts. "A touching story. But emotions don't change facts. Weyland shipped legitimate specimens. If contamination occurred, it was during transport."
"Then why," Yuen asks quietly, "did you already have insurance claims filed before we even docked? Before any investigation?"
The silence stretches. Kellerman's smile returns, but colder.
"Standard corporate efficiency. Now, about our offer..."
Roll a Persuasion check (d20 + 0) to see if your group's unified front is starting to frustrate Kellerman into revealing more.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 14 on a 

claude: Persuasion check: 14 (Success!)
Kellerman's composure cracks, just slightly. His jaw tightens, and he leans back in his chair - the first defensive gesture he's made.
"Our offer," he says, voice harder now, "is generous considering the circumstances. Considering that U.E.S. will likely fold after paying out damages. Considering that you three will be unemployable once word spreads that you were on the contamination ship."
There it is - the stick after the carrot.
"But perhaps," he continues, "we should discuss individual arrangements. Dr. Yuen, as the cargo specialist who signed off on these containers, you bear particular responsibility. Weyland could pursue criminal negligence charges. Or... we could ensure your medical license transfers smoothly to a core world hospital. Your choice."
He's trying to split you up, just as Holbrook predicted.
"Mr. Stargazer, your memory anomaly makes you an unreliable witness. No court would take your testimony seriously. But 250,000 

claude: s could buy excellent neurological treatment."
"And Ms. Chen, junior engineers are easily replaced. But with Weyland's recommendation, you could have your own ship to run."
Yuen's knuckles are white as she grips her wheelchair arms. Chen's face is flushed with anger.
"We should discuss this together," you say carefully. "As a crew."
Kellerman's smile turns predatory. "Oh, but Mr. Stargazer, there is no crew anymore. The Wanderer is destroyed. Morrison is dead. You're just three individuals with potentially conflicting interests."
He stands. "I'll give you 24 hours to consider. Each of you. Separately. My direct line will be open for individual negotiations."
He reaches to cut the connection, then pauses. "Oh, one more thing. Weyland's security division has been alerted to potential theft of proprietary biological data. If any such data were to surface, we would pursue it vigorously. Such theft carries a twenty-year sentence."
The screen goes dark.
Chen explodes. "That slimy, threatening—"
"He just admitted it," Yuen interrupts quietly. "Proprietary biological data. Not archaeological specimens. He just confirmed they knew what it was."
What does Dax do?

player: dax perks up at yuen's last comment. he frantically checks the terminal to see if it might have been recording. he asks yuen to call the director and see if they were listening, recording. 

claude: Your four arms move in a blur across the terminal, searching for any recording function. The diplomatic suite's comm system is more advanced than the quarantine rooms - there has to be something...
Roll a Technology check (d20 + 3) to see if you can find evidence the conversation was recorded.
While you're searching, Yuen is already reaching for the secure line Holbrook gave you. "Director, this is Dr. Yuen. Did you—"
"We monitor all incoming corporate communications to diplomatic quarters," Holbrook's voice comes through immediately. "Yes, we have it. Mr. Kellerman's admission about 'proprietary biological data' is now part of the official record."
Chen lets out a whoop of triumph. "He slipped! The bastard actually slipped!"
"Don't celebrate yet," Holbrook warns. "He'll claim it was a figure of speech, that he meant the archaeological specimens had proprietary value. But it's a crack in their story. Combined with other evidence..."
She pauses. "Mr. Stargazer, are you recording this conversation as well?"
Your fingers are still dancing across the terminal interface, looking for the system's recording cache.
What did you roll for the Technology check? The result will determine what else you might find in the system - possibly even a way to retrieve past communications or hidden functions in the diplomatic suite's systems.

player: Technology check: 22 (rolled 

claude: Technology check: 22 (Critical Success!)
Your fingers fly across the terminal with the fluid precision that made you the Wanderer's best tech specialist. The diplomatic suite's system isn't just advanced - it's deliberately transparent, designed for exactly this kind of situation.
"Got it!" You pull up the system architecture. "Director, this entire suite is wired for diplomatic protection protocols. Everything coming in or out is triple-cached - local storage, security backup, and..." your mandibles click in satisfaction, "legal archive with tamper-proof timestamps."
"Correct," Holbrook confirms. "The diplomatic wing was designed for exactly these situations. Corporate intimidation of witnesses is, sadly, not uncommon."
But you're not done. Your successful probing reveals something else - a hidden partition in the system showing ALL of Kellerman's recent communication attempts.
"Director, he's been trying to contact us individually for the past two hours," you report, scanning the logs. "Sixteen attempts to reach Dr. Yuen's private terminal, twelve to Chen's, eight to mine. All blocked by your security protocols."
"The man's desperate," Chen observes. "He knows he messed up."
Yuen is studying the recording playback on her screen. "There - right there. When he said 'proprietary biological data,' his left eye twitched. It's a tell. He knew he'd made an error the moment he said it."
Your exploration also reveals something interesting: "Director, your security chief Torres has been routing all of Kellerman's attempted communications through a forensic analyzer. She's building a pattern profile - trying to predict his next move."
"Torres is thorough," Holbrook says with satisfaction. "Now, we have 24 hours before his deadline. He'll try to circumvent our protections, maybe even attempt physical contact. Be ready."
The terminal beeps. Another incoming message - this time from Jonathan Park, U.E.S.
"Official debrief in one hour," his message reads. "Director Holbrook has provided secure conference room. Please be prepared to give full accounting of events."
Chen looks at the message queue. "Kellerman's still trying to call. Every thirty seconds now."
"Let him sweat," Yuen says with unusual firmness. "We have what we need."
What does Dax do? You have an hour before the official U.E.S. debrief, Kellerman's admission on record, and a increasingly desperate corporate lawyer trying to contact you.

player: ask the director what she advises we do with 

claude: "Director," you say, pulling up Park's nervous profile from yesterday, "what do you recommend we tell Park? He's our employer's rep, but he's clearly out of his depth."
Holbrook considers. "Jonathan Park is a middle manager who thought he'd gotten a cushy station posting. He's not equipped for this level of corporate warfare. That said, he's not your enemy - he's just terrified of losing U.E.S. even more money."
"So we tell him...?" Chen prompts.
"The truth, but carefully. He needs to file his report to U.E.S. headquarters. If he panics and writes something that contradicts your statements, Kellerman will use it. Keep it simple: you were hired for a salvage run, Morrison was given falsified cargo manifests, Weyland is trying to blame you for their deception."
Torres's voice cuts in over the comm. "Director, Kellerman just tried to physically enter Section A. My team turned him away, but he's claiming legal right to access his company's 'stolen property.'"
"He means Martinez's data log," Yuen says quietly.
Holbrook's tone sharpens. "He has no such rights. Torres, maintain security. Now, survivors - Park is essentially harmless but he's also transparent. Assume anything you tell him will be public knowledge within hours. He can't help it; when he's nervous, he talks."
The terminal shows another blocked call from Kellerman, then a text message that somehow got through: "Individual offers expire in 23 hours. Consider your futures carefully."
"One more thing," Holbrook adds. "Park's already received three separate 'briefings' from Kellerman's legal team. They're trying to confuse him with technical details. Keep your story clear and consistent. Don't let him get tangled in Weyland's web."
Chen checks the time. "Forty-five minutes until Park arrives."
What does Dax do to prepare? Would you like to coordinate your story with Chen and Yuen, review any evidence, or make any other preparations before the U.E.S. debrief?

player: dax thanks the director and assures her they're on it before ending the call naturally.
he turns to chen and yuen and says something to the effect of, obviously we're not taking weyland's deal, right? mostly in jest, partly an earnest ask just in case either of the other two are 

claude: "Thanks, Director. We're on it," you say, closing the connection with a polite nod.
You turn to Chen and Yuen, letting out a dry laugh - a clicking sound from your throat that humans find unsettling but your crewmates have learned means amusement. "So, obviously we're not taking Kellerman's deal... right?"
The question hangs half-joking, but you watch their faces carefully. After everything, you need to know they're solid.
Chen snorts. "Oh sure, let me just sell my soul for a ship to run. Because working for the company that murdered our crew sounds like a real career boost." She shakes her head. "Besides, they'd probably space me the first time I asked too many questions."
Yuen is quieter, staring at her hands. For a moment, you worry she might actually be considering it. Then she looks up. "They killed Morrison. They killed everybody. They tried to kill us." Her voice is steady, cold. "I signed those containers because I was deceived. But if I take their money now, knowing what they are? Then I really am complicit."
She shifts in her wheelchair. "Besides, twenty years for theft of biological data? They're threatening us with prison while offering bribes. That tells me they're scared of what we know."
"Martinez's data log," Chen says, patting her pocket where it's hidden. "They don't know we have it, but they're worried we might."
You check the time. Thirty minutes before Park arrives.
"Alright, so we're united. We stick to the simple truth with Park - we were crew doing our jobs, Morrison was a hero, Weyland deceived everyone. Nothing about memory locks or prior knowledge."
Chen grins. "And we let Kellerman stew in his own desperation for 23 more hours."
Roll a Perception check (d20 + 1) to notice something about your surroundings before the debrief.
What do you roll?

player: shit, Perception check: 4 (rolled 3+1)but also, dax starts to worry about martinez' data log. weyland's going nuts trying to get hold of it. he wants to backup the data into something, anything, in as secure a way as possible to maintain its validity as evidence. just in case it gets taken from 

claude: Perception check: 4 (Failed)
You're so focused on the data log problem that you don't notice the subtle hum of surveillance equipment activating in the corner of the room, or the way the air vent grating shifts slightly.
"Chen, we need to backup Martinez's data," you say urgently. "If Weyland's this desperate—"
"Already thinking the same thing," Chen interrupts, pulling out the small device. "But we need to maintain chain of custody for it to be valid evidence. Can't just copy it wildly."
You move to the terminal, your tech expertise kicking in. "The diplomatic suite has forensic data protocols. We can create a legally admissible backup with tamper-proof encryption and timestamp verification."
Roll a Technology check (d20 + 3) to create a secure, legally valid backup of Martinez's data log.
Chen keeps watch by the door while Yuen monitors the communications terminal for any more attempts from Kellerman.
"Twenty minutes until Park," Yuen warns. "And Kellerman just tried calling again. Text message this time: 'Dr. Yuen, your medical future depends on the next 23 hours. Think carefully.'"
"Focusing on her because she seems most vulnerable," Chen observes. "Injured, guilty about the cargo. He's a predator."
The data log's interface glows as you connect it to the terminal. The file sizes are larger than expected - Martinez documented everything. Video logs, shipping manifests, communication records...
"This is it," you mutter, working to establish the secure backup. "This is what terrifies them."
What do you roll for the Technology check?

player: Technology check: 11 (rolled 

claude: Technology check: 11 (Partial Success)
You manage to create a backup, but the process is messier than you'd like. The diplomatic suite's forensic protocols are more complex than expected - designed for legal documents, not military-grade encrypted logs.
"Got it... mostly," you mutter as the progress bar completes. "The backup is secure and timestamped, but I had to compress some of the video files. The manifests and communication records are perfect, but some of Martinez's personal video logs lost resolution."
"Better than nothing," Chen says, but she's frowning. "Wait, did you—"
Suddenly, the terminal flashes a warning: "EXTERNAL ACCESS ATTEMPT DETECTED - BLOCKED"
Your hasty backup triggered a security flag. Someone just tried to piggyback on your connection to access the system.
"Kellerman's team," Yuen says grimly. "They're monitoring for any data transfers."
You quickly check - the backup is secure in the diplomatic suite's legal archive, but now Weyland knows you're doing something with data. They don't know what, but they know you're active.
A knock at the door interrupts. "Mr. Park here for the debrief," comes a nervous voice.
Chen quickly pockets the original data log while you close all the backup protocols.
Park enters, looking even more frazzled than yesterday. His suit is wrinkled, there's coffee stains on his sleeve, and his hands shake slightly as he sets up his recording device.
"I, uh, I need to take your official statements for U.E.S. records," he stammers. "Mr. Kellerman has been... very insistent that I get your full account. He's called me seventeen times this morning."
The poor man looks like he hasn't slept.
"He offered me a promotion," Park says suddenly, then looks horrified at himself. "I mean, he suggested U.E.S. might benefit from... I shouldn't have said that."
Yuen gives you a meaningful look. Kellerman's trying to buy everyone.
What does Dax do?

player: dax starts to try to calm park, and looks to yuen to carry it on.
(btw you can roll for chen and yuen in situations like this)
he then starts into the same spiel again, increasingly more rehearsed. this time, honest but only critical information. less of the gore and emotion, more of the cold 

claude: "Mr. Park, please, sit down. Take a breath," you say gently, gesturing to a chair with one of your lower arms. "You look exhausted."
Yuen smoothly takes over, her medical training showing. "When did you last eat something? Chen, get him some water from the dispenser."
Rolling Persuasion for Yuen (d20+2): 15 (Success!)
Park visibly relaxes as Yuen's calm bedside manner takes effect. "I... thank you. Kellerman's been relentless. He even showed up at my quarters at 0500."
"That's harassment," Chen says flatly, handing him water. "You could file a complaint."
"Against Weyland?" Park laughs bitterly, then takes a shaky sip.
You begin your account, stripped of emotion this time. Just facts. "The Wanderer was contracted for salvage operation. Captain Morrison received cargo containers with manifests listing inert archaeological specimens from LV-426. Dr. Yuen verified the seals and documentation as per protocol. During transit, biological contamination occurred. The organisms were aggressive and infected multiple crew members."
You continue methodically through the timeline. Chen and Yuen occasionally add technical details - Chen about the engineering failures, Yuen about the medical impossibilities of containing the infection.
Park types frantically, trying to keep up. "And the captain?"
"Maintained quarantine protocols until the end," you state simply. "He ensured no contamination reached the escape pods. Saved the station from infection."
Park pauses his typing. "Kellerman says you stole proprietary data."
Rolling Insight for Chen (d20+1): 16 (Success!)
Chen catches your eye - Park isn't accusing, he's fishing. He wants you to give him something to push back against Kellerman with.
"We escaped with our lives and the clothes on our backs," Chen says carefully. "Any logs or records would be standard ship data, property of U.E.S., not Weyland."
Park nods quickly, typing. "Of course. Standard operational records. Property of the ship's owner." He looks up meaningfully. "U.E.S. would have legal claim to any such records, if they existed."
The room goes quiet except for his typing. Then Park asks, "Is there anything else I should know? Officially, I mean. For the record."
What does Dax do?

player: dax looks at the other two and let's park know that's the whole story. it's clear they'll have much better luck with the director than with UES going forward. dax almost begins resigning in his mind as he reaches this realization; grateful though he is with park's apparent 

claude: You exchange glances with Chen and Yuen. "That's the whole story, Mr. Park. Everything relevant to U.E.S.'s needs."
Park nods, still typing, but his shoulders slump slightly. You can see it in his eyes - he knows U.E.S. can't protect you from Weyland. A small shipping company versus a interstellar corporation? The math is brutal.
"I'll file this immediately," Park says quietly. "For what it's worth, I believe you. Morrison was a good captain. But..." he trails off, closing his tablet. "U.E.S. has maybe six months of operating capital left. The insurance claim from losing the Wanderer will bankrupt us. I'll probably be job hunting myself soon."
He stands to leave, then pauses at the door. "Director Holbrook has real authority here. Independent stations have their own laws." He meets your eyes. "I'm just saying, if I were in your position, I'd be thinking about who can actually protect me."
After Park leaves, Chen breaks the silence. "He's basically telling us to jump ship."
"Can you blame him?" Yuen asks. "U.E.S. is done. They can't fight Weyland."
You feel your lower arms curl involuntarily - a Vexian stress response. Your entire career, such as it was, is evaporating. But then again, you're alive. Morrison and the others aren't.
The terminal chimes. Another message from Kellerman: "22 hours remain. Individual meetings can be arranged through secure channels."
Then, unexpectedly, a second message appears - from Director Holbrook: "Mr. Park just filed his report. I'd like to discuss your future options. All three of you. My office, at your convenience."
Chen looks at the competing messages. "Two very different paths."
"Not really," Yuen says firmly. "One's a trap, the other's a lifeline."
What does Dax do?

player: i don't think dax values UES particularly as a 'home', not in a corporate sense. he probably doesn't lament the loss of UES as a company or of his job; he knows he's incredible skilled, he could get a job anywhere. but he has more important things on his mind right now.growing frustrated with kellerman's constant messages, dax looks for a way to block notifications from him on their shared terminal. "pest" he says.
they then go to meet the 

claude: You mutter "Pest" in Vexian - a particularly satisfying curse that sounds like grinding gears - as another notification from Kellerman pops up. Your fingers dance across the terminal, finding the notification settings.
Rolling Technology check (d20+3): 14 (Success!)
You quickly set up a filter that routes all of Kellerman's messages to a separate folder. They'll still be recorded for evidence, but won't interrupt you every thirty seconds.
"There," you say with satisfaction. "He can shout into the void."
Chen grins. "Nice. Now let's go see someone actually worth talking to."
The walk to Holbrook's office takes you through the administrative heart of Titan Station. Unlike the corporate sectors with their logos and polished surfaces, this area feels functional, lived-in. The walls have scuff marks from years of foot traffic. The people you pass nod respectfully but don't stare - they've seen stranger things than a Vexian and his injured crewmates.
Commander Torres meets you at the security checkpoint. "Director's expecting you," she says crisply, then adds in a lower voice, "Kellerman tried to follow you. He's currently enjoying a lengthy security screening."
Holbrook's office overlooks Saturn's rings. The massive gas giant fills half the view, its storms swirling in ancient patterns. The Director stands with her back to you, hands clasped behind her.
"Twelve ships this week have cancelled their docking requests," she says without turning. "Word's already spreading about the contamination incident. Even though we contained it, fear travels faster than truth."
She faces you. "Which brings us to your situation. Park's report makes it clear U.E.S. can't protect you. Kellerman won't stop. And I have a station to protect from both biological contamination and corporate predation."
She gestures to chairs. "So let's discuss realistic options. I can't offer you millions in 

claude: s, but I can offer something Kellerman can't - legitimate legal protection and a chance to see justice done."
"What are you proposing?" Yuen asks.
"Formal refugee status under station law. You'd be under my direct protection while we build a case. My legal team has been studying the recordings. Combined with proper evidence, we might actually nail Weyland for deliberate biological warfare."
She pauses. "But I need complete honesty. No more partial truths. If we're doing this, I need to know everything."
Chen shifts uncomfortably. The data log suddenly feels heavy in her pocket.
What does Dax do?

player: dax looks to the others for agreement, wanting to make sure this is a decision all three of them make together. they've not chosen a 'leader' among them, they're flying by the seat of their pants. 
dax gauges chen's response, though he's confident from her words earlier that she wants the same thing he does - justice. with that, he suggests handing the datapad over to the director to ensure its security. he also lets her know he... tried to back it up to their room terminal, but that her experts might want to take a second look at 

claude: You look between Chen and Yuen, catching their eyes. This needs to be unanimous - you've survived by trusting each other, and that can't change now.
Chen meets your gaze steadily, then gives a small nod. Her hand moves to her pocket protectively, but her expression is resolute.
Yuen doesn't hesitate. "We're in this together," she says simply. "All three of us, or none of us."
You turn back to Holbrook. "We accept. And in the interest of complete honesty..." You gesture to Chen, who slowly pulls out Martinez's data log and places it on the Director's desk.
Holbrook's eyebrows rise slightly. "Is this—"
"Security Chief Martinez's personal log," Chen confirms. "He was documenting irregularities before he died. Everything's on there - shipping manifests, communication records, his own investigations."
"I tried to create a backup on our room's terminal," you add, your mandibles clicking slightly in embarrassment. "The forensic protocols were more complex than expected. Your experts might want to review my attempt - I compressed some files and may have triggered a security flag that Kellerman's team detected."
Rolling Insight for Director Holbrook (d20+3): 18
Holbrook studies the three of you carefully, then picks up the data log with surprising reverence. "Martinez was a good man. Thorough." She activates her comm. "Torres, bring in our digital forensics lead. Full chain of custody protocols."
She turns back to you. "The backup attempt was smart, even if imperfect. We'll secure both versions." She pauses. "Is there anything else? Any other pieces of this puzzle?"
Chen and Yuen look at you. The memory lock is still your secret to share or keep.
What does Dax do?

player: dax looks to yuen for approval to share the memory 

claude: You turn to Yuen, raising an eyebrow in silent question. The memory lock was her work as much as yours - she deserves a say in whether to reveal it.
Yuen hesitates, her fingers drumming nervously on her wheelchair arm. Then she takes a deep breath and nods. "Tell her. All of it."
You face Holbrook. "Three weeks ago, I discovered something about the cargo. Connected some dots about Weyland's involvement. I went to Dr. Yuen with my suspicions."
"And I helped him hide those memories," Yuen continues, her voice steady now. "A neurological lock. Temporary amnesia triggered by specific circumstances. We knew if Weyland was involved, they'd have ways of extracting information. So we made sure there was nothing to extract."
Holbrook leans back slowly. "That's why your medical scan showed anomalies. You deliberately gave yourself brain damage as insurance."
"Reversible," you clarify. "The memories came back during the crisis. But it meant during any initial interrogation, I genuinely couldn't remember what I'd discovered."
"Martinez knew too," Chen adds. "That's probably why he started his detailed documentation."
Torres enters with the forensics lead, a thin man who immediately handles the data log like a holy relic. "Chain of custody begins now," he says, scanning it with a handheld device.
Holbrook stands. "This changes things. 

claude: ated memory suppression suggests you knew the cargo was dangerous enough to warrant extreme measures." She looks at each of you. "You three have been playing a longer game than anyone realized."
"We were trying to survive," you say simply. "And get evidence."
"Well, you succeeded. Torres, implement Protocol Seven. Our three guests are now material witnesses under station protection. Full security detail, restricted access, and..." she smiles slightly, "complete communications blackout from Weyland representatives."
The relief in the room is palpable.
"Kellerman's going to lose his mind," Chen says with satisfaction.
"Let him," Holbrook replies. "We have 21 hours before his deadline. Let's see how desperate he gets when he realizes his prey has found sanctuary."
What does Dax do?

player: dax feels a weight off his shoulders, having let the director know everything. he's confident they've made the right choice in trusting her. 
he suggests the three head back to their room for a chat, with no prying 

claude: The weight that's been crushing your chest for days finally lifts. Your secondary arms, which had been held defensively tight against your body, relax for the first time since you woke from cryo.
"Director, thank you," you say simply. "We should head back to our quarters now. Let you and your team work."
Holbrook nods. "Torres will assign you a discrete security detail. They'll be around but not intrusive. Get some rest - real rest. Tomorrow we start building the case properly."
The walk back feels different. The station corridors seem less oppressive, the recycled air easier to breathe. Even Yuen looks lighter despite her injuries.
Once your quarters' door seals behind you, Chen immediately checks for surveillance devices - old habit from the Wanderer. "We're clean," she confirms.
You settle into chairs facing each other, no terminal between you, no official recording. Just three survivors who've been through hell together.
"So," Chen says, breaking the silence. "We actually did it. We're safe. Relatively speaking."
"For now," Yuen adds, but without her earlier pessimism. "Kellerman won't give up easily."
You lean forward. "We need to talk about what happens next. Not the legal case - us. We're not crew anymore. Park was right about that at least. So what are we to each other now?"
It's the question that's been hovering unasked. Are you three going to stick together after this is over, or will you drift apart once the crisis ends?
"I've been thinking about that," Chen says quietly. "We know each other's worst moments now. Saw each other break and keep going anyway. That's not something you just walk away from."
Yuen shifts in her wheelchair. "Morrison would want us to look out for each other. He died to save us - all of us. That means something."
The room falls quiet, each of you lost in thought about what comes after justice, after survival, after the adrenaline fades.
What does Dax say to his companions about their future?

player: dax suggests they team up - officially. maybe not on paper just yet, not while weyland is still likely watching things like crew manifests and whatever a 'registered team' might look like legally. but dax says dedicating himself to this cause, with these two, for the sake of their crewmates, would be nothing short of an honor.
dax wants to start a conversation to learn about one another. ic it's to learn more about their histories, their strengths. ooc it's to get a gauge for their stats and skills. 
he wants to use it to start the talk of leadership... at this point, dax thinks any one of them could do it, for a multitude of reasons. but yuen's experience, intelliegnce calmness under pressure makes her a solid 

claude: "We should team up - officially," you say, your voice carrying a certainty you haven't felt in days. "Not on paper yet, not while Weyland's watching crew manifests and legal registrations. But dedicating myself to this cause, with you two, for Morrison and the others... it would be an honor."
Chen's eyes brighten. "A team. I like that. Better than drifting apart and always wondering 'what if.'"
"But we need to know each other better," you continue. "Not just as crewmates in crisis, but as people. Our strengths, our backgrounds. If we're doing this, we do it smart."
You lean back. "I'll start. Grew up in the Vexian colony ships - you know how we are about tech and spatial navigation. Four arms help with multitasking. I'm good with systems, patterns, making connections others miss. But I'm terrible at reading people sometimes, and my strength..." you flex one of your thinner upper arms, "let's just say I won't be winning any arm-wrestling contests."
Chen grins. "I noticed. Alright, my turn. Colony kid from Mars, engineering family going back three generations. I can fix anything with moving parts, and I'm quick on my feet - had to be, growing up in the lower sectors. Good in a fight, better at avoiding them. But I'm impulsive, you've probably noticed. Rush in first, think later."
Rolling to determine Chen's stats based on her description:

High DEX and INT, moderate CON and WIS, average STR and CHA

Yuen shifts, considering. "Earth-born, actually. Medical school on Luna. I'm... methodical. Careful. Good under pressure when I have time to think. Obviously medical training, but also biochemistry, some xenobiology." She pauses. "I'm older than both of you. More experienced with corporate politics. But I'm not a fighter, and I overthink things. Freeze when I need to act fast."
Rolling to determine Yuen's stats:

High INT and WIS, moderate CHA, lower DEX and STR, average CON

"Which brings up leadership," you say carefully. "We need someone making decisions when it counts. Yuen, your experience and calmness under pressure—"
"No," Yuen interrupts gently. "I appreciate the thought, but I'm support, not command. I hesitate. We saw that with Kellerman - I needed you two to push back."
Chen looks between you both. "Dax, you kept us alive. You figured out the conspiracy, managed the memory lock, got us to trust Holbrook. You think three steps ahead."
"But I miss social cues," you point out. "Nearly didn't catch Park's signals today."
"So we lead together," Chen suggests. "Play to strengths. Dax for strategy and tech, me for quick decisions and action, Yuen for analysis and keeping us grounded. Shared leadership."
Yuen nods slowly. "Like a proper crew. Different roles, equal voices."
"For Morrison and the others," you say, and the others echo it.
The moment is broken by the terminal chiming - another blocked message from Kellerman. The counter shows 47 attempts in the last hour.
"He's really losing it," Chen observes.
What does Dax want to discuss next with his new partners?

player: money and ties. there's a good chance they'll need to be mobile again soon. it's a tough conversation, but we need to know what resources we're working with. dax is entirely honest about all of it.
1. how much money, capital, etc. they each have
2. what obligations, familial or otherwise, they have and where, in case it becomes a blocker later 

claude: "We need to talk practical matters," you say, settling into a more serious tone. "If things go bad - and with Weyland, they might - we may need to move fast. Be mobile. We should know what resources we're working with."
Chen nods. "Smart. No surprises later."
"I'll start," you offer. "I've got about 3,000 

claude: s in savings. Not much, but I lived cheap on the Wanderer. No family in this system - my clutch-siblings are all back in Vexian space, two months' travel at best. No debts, no obligations. I can move tomorrow if needed."
Chen whistles low. "3,000? That's... responsible. I've got maybe 800 

claude: s. I send most of my pay to my younger brother on Mars - he's in technical school. Parents died in a pressure breach when I was fifteen. Just him and me now." She looks defensive. "I can't abandon him."
"No one's asking you to," Yuen says gently. "Family is family. I've got about 12,000 

claude: s saved. No immediate family - my parents passed years ago, no siblings. But..." she hesitates, "I've been sending money to a clinic on Europa. They treat miners who can't afford corporate healthcare. It's not an obligation, exactly, but—"
"It's who you are," you finish. "That's not a weakness."
"So between us, about 15,000 

claude: s plus whatever survivor benefits U.E.S. manages to pay out," Chen calculates. "That's maybe three months operating expenses if we're careful. Six if we're desperate."
"The station's supporting us for now," you point out. "But you're right, we need to think long-term."
Yuen adjusts her position, wincing slightly. "There's something else. My medical license is registered through Earth's regulatory board. If Weyland pushes, they could have it suspended pending investigation. That's my whole livelihood."
"My engineering certs are Mars-based," Chen adds. "Harder to revoke, but Weyland has offices there."
"My technical certifications are through the Vexian Trade Collective," you say. "Weyland has no influence there, but it means nothing in human space without corporate sponsorship."
The weight of your vulnerability sits heavy in the room. Three people with modest savings and careers that could be destroyed with a few legal filings.
"We need this case to work," Chen says quietly. "Not just for justice. For survival."
"Or we need to disappear completely," Yuen suggests. "New identities, outer colonies where Weyland has no reach."
"That costs more than 15,000 

claude: s," you note. "Good fake identities that would fool biometric scans? We're talking 50,000 minimum."
The terminal chimes again. This time it's not Kellerman - it's Director Holbrook.
"Preliminary review of Martinez's data is revealing significant evidence. Legal team wants to meet tomorrow at 0800. Also, Mr. Kellerman has formally requested arbitration. I've denied it, but he's escalating to sector authorities. We may have less time than we thought."
Chen looks at the message. "The clock's ticking faster."
What does Dax want to do with the remaining evening?

player: dax wants to reassure them that their obligations back home will be accounted for every step of the way. he wants them to consider what belongs to one, belongs to all - the profit and the debt both (not in those words though, i can't find another way to say it lol). 
he suggests they get some food in their shared quarters and chit-chat over dinner, then head for a good 

claude: "Listen," you say, leaning forward, your lower arms gesturing for emphasis. "Your obligations - Chen's brother, Yuen's clinic - those are our obligations now. We share everything. The profits when we have them, the debts when they come. Three bodies, one fund."
Chen blinks, surprised. "Dax, that's... you barely know us."
"I know enough. We survived hell together. We're choosing to fight together. That means all in." You click your mandibles thoughtfully. "My people, we have a saying - 'The web holds because all strands share the weight.'"
Yuen's eyes soften. "That's either very noble or very naive."
"Maybe both," you admit. "But it's how teams become family."
Chen runs her hand through her hair. "Alright. Three bodies, one fund. But I'm keeping track of every 

claude:  - fair's fair."
"Agreed," Yuen says. "Now, can we please eat? Hospital food was terrible and I'm starving."
You move to the kitchenette, grateful for the normal domesticity of finding food. The diplomatic quarters have a decent selection - actual fresh vegetables, protein that isn't reconstituted, even some Vexian fungi that makes you unexpectedly homesick.
As you prepare dinner together - Chen chopping vegetables with engineering precision, Yuen directing from her chair, you handling multiple tasks with practiced ease - the conversation drifts to lighter things.
"So," Chen asks, stealing a piece of carrot, "how does a Vexian end up on a human crew anyway?"
"Stubbornness," you reply, managing three pans at once. "Told my clutch-mother I wanted to see the galaxy. She said stick to Vexian ships. I signed with U.E.S. the next day."
"Rebel," Chen laughs. "I like it."
Over dinner, you trade stories. Chen's first spacewalk where she forgot to tether and had to be rescued by a very irritated supervisor. Yuen's medical school prank involving anatomically correct jello sculptures. Your first time trying human coffee and being awake for three days straight.
For an hour, you're not survivors or witnesses or targets. You're just three friends sharing a meal.
As you clean up, the terminal shows Kellerman has sent 73 blocked messages.
"New record," Chen observes.
"Let him stew," Yuen yawns. "I need actual sleep. Tomorrow's going to be intense."
You all head to your respective rooms, but leave the connecting doors open - close enough to hear if anyone needs help. It's a small gesture, but it matters.
Roll a Perception check (d20+1) for any nighttime disturbances or dreams.
What do you roll?

player: Perception check: 18 (rolled 

claude: Perception check: 18 (Success!)
Around 0300, your subconscious picks up something - a subtle vibration through the station's hull that doesn't match the normal rhythm of Titan's systems. Your Vexian ancestry makes you sensitive to structural harmonics, and this is... wrong.
Your eyes snap open. Through the open connecting doors, you can hear Chen's steady breathing and Yuen's occasional shift in her bed. But there's something else - a faint scratching sound from the ventilation system.
You silently rise, all four arms moving in practiced quiet as you approach the vent. The scratching stops immediately. Then, barely visible through the grating, you catch a glimpse of something retreating - a small drone, no bigger than your fist.
Surveillance drone. Not station standard - too sleek, too quiet.
You quickly wake the others with gentle touches. Chen comes alert instantly, hand reaching for a weapon that isn't there. Yuen takes a moment longer, still groggy from pain meds.
"Drone in the vents," you whisper. "Someone's watching."
Chen curses quietly. "Kellerman?"
"Or someone working for him," Yuen suggests.
You examine the vent more closely. The grating has micro-scratches around the screws - it's been removed and replaced recently. Professional job, but not perfect.
"They've probably been monitoring us since we got here," you realize. "Maybe heard everything."
"The data log," Chen says, alarmed.
"Already with Holbrook's people," Yuen reminds her. "But they know we had it."
The terminal suddenly lights up with an incoming message - not blocked this time. It's from an unknown sender:
"Impressive detection skills, Mr. Stargazer. Most people never notice our surveillance. Consider this a professional courtesy - Kellerman has hired private contractors. Your 18-hour deadline stands, but the parameters have changed. We have recordings of your conspiracy discussion. Accepting Weyland's offer is no longer optional. - Osprey Security Solutions"
Chen reads it over your shoulder. "Private military contractors. This just escalated."
What does Dax do?

player: dax signals to chen to help him get the grate off and retrieve the surveillance 

claude: You signal to Chen, pointing at the vent with two arms while miming unscrewing with the others. She nods immediately, understanding.
"Yuen, keep watch on the door," you whisper.
Chen grabs a multi-tool from her personal kit - one of the few things she salvaged - while you position yourself to catch whatever's in there. Your four arms give you an advantage for this kind of delicate work.
Rolling Technology check for Dax (d20+3): 16 (Success!)
The screws come out smoothly. You've done this before on the Wanderer, chasing circuit problems through ventilation shafts. As the grate comes free, you spot the drone - it's trying to back away deeper into the vent.
Rolling Dexterity check for Chen (d20+4): 19 (Success!)
Chen's hand shoots into the vent with the speed that comes from years of grabbing tools in zero-g before they float away. "Got it!"
She pulls out a matte black drone, no bigger than a clenched fist. It's still active, a red recording light blinking.
"High-end tech," you observe, examining it with your upper arms while your lower ones hold it steady. "Military grade. This thing costs more than we have in savings combined."
"It's still transmitting," Chen notes, pointing at an indicator light.
"Not for long," you say, finding the main processor with practiced ease. One quick twist and the drone goes dead.
"They know we found it," Yuen says from her position by the door. "That message timing wasn't coincidence."
You crack open the drone's casing. Inside is a memory chip and... something else. A maker's mark. "Osprey Security Solutions. Same group that signed the message."
"Private military contractors doing corporate espionage," Chen says grimly. "This is beyond Kellerman's authority. Someone higher up at Weyland authorized this."
The terminal chimes again. Director Holbrook: "Security alert in your sector. My team is en route. Do not leave your quarters."
Thirty seconds later, Torres and two security officers arrive. She takes one look at the disabled drone in your hands and curses creatively.
"How long?" she asks.
"Could have been hours. Maybe since we arrived," you admit. "I only noticed it at 0300."
Torres activates her comm. "Director, we have a confirmed breach. Osprey Solutions, military-grade surveillance drone in the diplomatic quarters."
Holbrook's voice crackles back: "Lockdown Protocol Nine. No one enters or leaves Section A without my authorization."
Torres turns to you three. "Pack what you need. We're moving you to the secure wing. If Osprey's involved, Kellerman's not playing corporate games anymore. This is something else."
What does Dax do?

player: dax complies fully, packing his things and heading with torres. he asks torres what they can do with the drone to figure out what it knows, where it was sending 

claude: You quickly gather your few possessions - not much survived the Wanderer. As you pack, you hand the disabled drone to Torres.
"Can your people extract data from this? Find out what it recorded, where it was transmitting?"
Torres examines the drone with professional interest. "Our forensics team can try. Osprey's good, but they're not infallible." She bags it carefully. "This is evidence of corporate espionage on a diplomatic station. That's a federal crime."
As you move through the corridors, Chen carrying both her bag and helping steady Yuen, you notice Torres's security detail is larger than before - six officers in full tactical gear.
"Osprey Security," you say to Torres as you walk. "What are we dealing with?"
"Ex-military contractors. They do the work corporations can't officially sanction. Intimidation, extraction, sometimes worse." She glances back at you. "If Weyland hired them, someone very high up is very worried about what you know."
The secure wing is deep in the station's core - no external walls, no vents large enough for drones, one heavily guarded entrance. Your new quarters are smaller but feel safer - a common room with three attached bedrooms, military-grade security systems visible on every surface.
"My forensics team will work on the drone," Torres says. "We might be able to trace the transmission endpoint, see where the data was going. Osprey's tough, but they sometimes get sloppy with their encryption when they think they won't get caught."
Holbrook appears on the secure terminal. "The drone changes things. I'm advancing our timeline. Legal team will meet you at 0600 instead of 0800. We need to file charges before Osprey tries something more direct."
"More direct?" Chen asks.
"Extraction. Kidnapping. Making you disappear." Holbrook's expression is grim. "They've done it before. Never proved, but suspected in twelve cases of missing witnesses."
Roll an Intelligence check (d20+3) to recall anything you might know about Osprey or similar contractors from your time in space.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 19 on a d20 +3 for 

claude: Intelligence check: 22 (Critical Success!)
The name Osprey triggers a cascade of memories - spacer rumors, hushed conversations in stations bars, and one very specific incident.
"Osprey Security Solutions," you say slowly. "They were behind the Ceres Mining whistleblower disappearance three years ago. The pattern's identical - surveillance first, escalating pressure, then the witness vanished during a 'transport malfunction.' They also worked the Proxima bioweapons coverup."
Your lower arms gesture as you recall more details. "They have a signature method - they prefer to make problems disappear legally first. 

claude:  witnesses, find leverage, force compliance. But if that fails within 48 hours, they shift to direct action."
"48 hours?" Yuen asks.
