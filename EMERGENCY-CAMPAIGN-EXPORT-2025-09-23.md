# EMERGENCY CAMPAIGN EXPORT - 2025-10-02

### Entry 1 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You're absolutely right! Looking back at the logs:
In the Central Hub, you found Officer Rostova's body and discovered an emergency diagnostic port behind the console that was still powered. From the Gemini transcript:
"Furthermore, while examining her gear, you notice a faint green light nearby. Tucked behind the console is an emergency diagnostic port, still humming with a low, steady power feed from an independent battery. It's not much, but it's more than enough to slowly recharge your medical scanner or other small devices."
So yes - you can plug your medical scanner into that port in the Central Hub to recharge it! But that means going back through the Hub to reach it. The scanner is currently dead in your inventory, but it could be recharged if you return to that console.
That's actually a great tactical consideration. The scanner could:

Detect life signs (find survivors or threats)
Analyze that heat signature below before you descend
Get more data on the alien biology if you encounter another creature

Do you want to:

Head back to Central Hub first to recharge the scanner
Go straight down to the storage bay without it
Take a different path entirely

What's Dax thinking?


### Entry 2 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
ah shit, i didn't actually charge it hah. fuck.
okay, dax confirmed on the terminal exactly where the heat signature is coming from, in relation to him, this room, and the storage


### Entry 3 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You turn back to the console, your fingers dancing across the interface to bring up the thermal sensor array. The system is damaged, but functional enough to give you a clearer picture.
The display refreshes, showing a cross-section of Engineering:
Your Position: Main Engineering deck, at the primary console.
The Heat Signature: It's not in the storage bay itself. It's in the maintenance shaft that runs parallel to the ladder well, about halfway down between your level and the storage level below. The signature is stationary now, body-temperature, roughly human-sized. It's been moving intermittently - sometimes completely still for minutes, then shifting position slightly.
Storage Bay Status: The actual storage bay shows cold - no heat signatures, no movement. The Plasma Injector should be in a sealed cabinet down there.
The maintenance shaft has an access panel on each level. There's one here on your deck (currently sealed), and another in the storage bay below. Whatever's in that shaft could emerge at either level... or might just be hiding.
Your tactical situation is clearer now:

The thing in the shaft seems to be alive but not actively hunting
You could potentially bypass it by moving quickly down the ladder
Or you could investigate the maintenance panel on this level first
The storage bay itself appears clear

The engineering instincts in you note that if it's human-sized and body-temperature, it could be another survivor in hiding. Or it could be something else entirely wearing a human shape.
What's your move?


### Entry 4 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax recalls the previous creature made a chitinous clicking sound before it was ever alerted to his presence. he attempts to listen out for the same sound, focusing in on it, locking out the other sounds of the


### Entry 5 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You close your eyes, letting your Vexian senses sharpen in the darkness. Your breathing slows. The background hum of the emergency generators fades. The distant groan of settling metal becomes white noise. You're listening for that specific sound - that wet, chitinous click-clack that haunted you through the corridors.
Roll for Perception to filter out the ship's ambient noise and detect any creature sounds.
Rolling Wisdom (Perception)...
d20 Roll: 16
Your Wisdom Modifier: +1
Total: 17 (Success!)
Your multifaceted ears, evolved for the subtle acoustic environment of Vexian caverns, parse the layers of sound with remarkable clarity.
You hear:

The steady thrum of life support
A faint drip of condensation somewhere above
The occasional spark from damaged conduits
Your own heartbeat

But NO chittering. No clicking. No scraping of chitin on metal.
Instead, from the maintenance shaft, you catch something else entirely: a soft, ragged breathing. Labored. Human or near-human. And underneath it, barely audible, a whispered mantra being repeated:
"...seven three five five... seven three five five... seven three five five..."
The same numbers from Officer Rostova's armory code. Over and over.
This isn't a Skitterer. This is a person. A survivor. And they sound like they're in bad shape - physically or mentally or both.
The maintenance access panel is 15 meters away, secured with a standard manual release wheel.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 6 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
(ey, woah, appreciate it but ask me to roll, remember?)oh fuck. dax sneaks back into the hub as quick as he can to charge his med scanner and returns to the engi


### Entry 7 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You're right - let me fix that! I should ask you to roll, not roll for you.

You close your eyes, letting your Vexian senses sharpen in the darkness. Your breathing slows as you try to filter out the ship's ambient noise and focus on any telltale creature sounds.
Roll a Perception check (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to see what you can hear.
Once you tell me what you rolled, I'll let you know what Dax picks up!
But first - you mentioned sneaking back to the Hub to charge the scanner. Smart move! The trek back through the massive Engineering bay to the door is tense but uneventful. You slip into the Central Hub, finding Officer Rostova's body still where you left it behind the console. The emergency diagnostic port glows with that faint green light.
You plug in the medical scanner. It takes about 30 seconds to charge enough for basic functionality. The device hums back to life, its small screen showing a battery indicator slowly filling.
Now, returning to Engineering with your newly charged scanner, you pause at the threshold. That heat signature is still on the thermal readings, still in the maintenance shaft between levels.
Want to make that Perception check now to listen for what's in the shaft? Roll when ready!


### Entry 8 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
(it was Perception check: 14 +1 =


### Entry 9 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Perception check: 15 (Success!)
Standing in the doorway of Engineering, your scanner charged and ready, you filter through the ship's cacophony of dying sounds. Your Vexian hearing picks up something that makes your blood run cold.
From the maintenance shaft, there's no chittering or clicking. Instead, you hear ragged, labored breathing - definitely humanoid. And underneath it, a barely audible whispered mantra:
"...seven three five five... seven three five five... seven three five five..."
Officer Rostova's armory code. Someone down there knows it. Someone who sounds hurt, terrified, or possibly losing their mind.
You now have your charged medical scanner in hand. The maintenance access panel is about 15 meters away from your position, a standard manual release wheel securing it. The thermal readings still show the figure hasn't moved from their position in the shaft between levels.
Your options are clearer now:

Use the scanner to get a reading through the maintenance panel (might tell you if they're injured, human, infected, etc.)
Open the panel and make contact
Ignore them and head straight down the ladder to the storage bay
Try to communicate through the panel first

What does Dax do?


### Entry 10 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax tries to get an angle to scan them from a distance without being


### Entry 11 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You move with practiced stealth, keeping to the shadows cast by the massive reactor housing. The medical scanner's weight is reassuring in your hand - finally, a chance to know what you're dealing with before it knows about you.
The maintenance shaft has ventilation grates at regular intervals along the wall. You identify one that should give you a good angle while keeping you concealed behind a bank of cooling pipes. From there, you could potentially scan through the grate without revealing your position.
Getting there without making noise will require careful movement across the debris-strewn engineering deck.
Roll a Stealth check (d20 + your Dexterity modifier of +4) to see if you can get into position without alerting whoever's in the shaft.
What do you roll?


### Entry 12 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
shit, Stealth check: 9 (rolled


### Entry 13 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Stealth check: 9 (Failure)
You begin creeping along the wall, using the cooling pipes for cover. Your four hands carefully place each step, avoiding the larger pieces of debris. You're halfway to the ventilation grate when your foot finds a section of deck plating that's come loose from its moorings.
CLANG
The metal plate shifts and bangs against its housing. The sound echoes through Engineering like a bell.
The breathing in the maintenance shaft stops instantly. Complete silence for three heartbeats. Then, a panicked scrambling sound - someone moving fast through the confined space, heading AWAY from you, deeper into the shaft system. You hear a muffled sob of terror and the continued frantic whisper, now faster, more desperate:
"Seven-three-five-five-seven-three-five-five-please-no-please-seven-three-five-five-"
They're moving toward the lower access panel - the one in the storage bay. If they exit there, they'll be right where you need to go for the Plasma Injector.
You could:

Race to the ladder and try to get down there first
Call out to identify yourself as friendly
Use the maintenance panel on this level to pursue through the shaft
Let them go and wait for them to clear the area

The medical scanner is still in your hand, unused. Whatever's in that shaft is terrified of you.
What does Dax do?

chase after them and attempt to get them to quiet down and recognise me as a


### Entry 15 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You sprint toward the ladder well, your four legs carrying you with Vexian speed. The panicked scrambling in the shaft is heading the same direction - down toward the storage bay.
"Wait!" you call out, trying to keep your voice calm and non-threatening. "I'm not going to hurt you! I'm Dax - I'm crew! Technical specialist!"
The scrambling doesn't stop. If anything, it gets more frantic. You reach the ladder and start descending quickly, trying to match their pace through the shaft.
"Listen to me!" you continue, your voice echoing in the ladder well. "I know about Rostova! I found her in the Central Hub - she gave me that code! Seven-three-five-five! I know about the armory!"
Roll a Persuasion check (d20 + your Charisma modifier of 0) to see if you can break through their panic and get them to recognize you as friendly.
As you're climbing down, you can hear them getting closer to the lower access panel. The storage bay is only seconds away for both of you.
What do you roll?


### Entry 16 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Persuasion check: 17 (rolled


### Entry 17 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Persuasion check: 17 (Success!)
The scrambling in the shaft suddenly stops. You hear ragged breathing, then a choked voice - female, young, terrified but trying to focus:
"R-Rostova? You... you found Rostova? Is she...?"
"She didn't make it," you say gently, still descending the ladder. "But she left her service number. She wanted someone to get to the armory. I'm here to help."
There's a long pause. Then the access panel below slowly, cautiously, creaks open. You reach the bottom of the ladder just as a figure tumbles out of the maintenance shaft onto the storage bay floor.
She's human, early twenties, wearing a torn engineering jumpsuit with the name "CHEN" on the patch. Her face is pale, streaked with grime and tears, and there's dried blood on her temple. She's clutching her left arm to her chest - it hangs at an wrong angle. She looks up at you with wide, terrified eyes that slowly focus on your Vexian features, then your uniform.
"You're... you're real," Chen whispers. "You're not one of those things. Oh god, I thought... I've been hiding for... I don't know how long. The things in the vents, they killed Martinez, they killed everyone, I saw them pull Martinez up into the—"
She's starting to hyperventilate, edging toward panic again.
You're in the storage bay now. The Plasma Injector cabinet is visible across the room. Chen needs medical attention, but she also might know crucial information about what happened here.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 18 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax remembers he picked up an array of items from the med bay. he scans chen and does his best to render medical aid, though he's better at fixing machines than people. he tries to get info from her chatting as they


### Entry 19 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You kneel beside Chen, pulling out your medical scanner with one hand while rifling through your supplies with the others. "I'm going to help you," you say calmly. "I've got medical supplies. Just keep talking to me - tell me what happened while I work."
You activate the scanner, its blue light washing over Chen as she flinches instinctively.
Scanner readout:

Dislocated left shoulder
Mild concussion
Dehydration
Elevated stress hormones
No biological contamination detected

"This is going to hurt," you warn, pulling out one of your Synth-Flesh applicators. "But I need to reset your shoulder first."
"Wait, wait—" Chen gasps, but you've already positioned your four hands - two to hold her steady, two to manipulate the joint.
Roll a Medicine check (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to see how well you handle the medical treatment. Or if you'd prefer, you could use Intelligence instead, approaching it like an engineering problem.
While you prepare, Chen starts talking through gritted teeth: "Three days ago... maybe four? The Captain brought something aboard from a derelict we found. Said it was... was valuable salvage. But the container breached in the cargo bay. These things... they got Ramirez first. Then they spread through the vents."
She shudders. "Martinez and I sealed ourselves in here, but they found us. Pulled him right up into the vent. I've been hiding in the maintenance shaft since, drinking condensation, trying not to make a sound. There's... there's more than one. At least three, maybe more."
What do you roll for the medical treatment?


### Entry 20 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
I rolled 11 on a d20, +1 so


### Entry 21 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Medicine check: 12 (Partial Success)
You grip Chen's shoulder, approaching it like a mechanical joint that needs realigning. "On three," you say. "One, two—"
You pull and rotate on two. The shoulder pops back into place with an audible crack. Chen screams, then slumps forward, gasping.
"You said three!" she wheezes.
"Works better when you're not tensed," you reply, already applying the Synth-Flesh applicator around her shoulder. The device hisses as it sprays a layer of artificial skin that hardens into a supportive mesh. It's not pretty - you've applied it a bit thick in some spots, thin in others - but it'll hold.
Chen flexes her fingers experimentally. "It... it works. Thanks."
As you tend to her head wound with your second Synth-Flesh applicator (you're now out), she continues:
"The things... Skitterers, Martinez called them. They hunt by sound. But there's something else too. Something bigger. I heard it once, moving through the main corridors. Heavy. Wet. The Skitterers went quiet when it passed."
She points toward the Plasma Injector cabinet. "That's what you're here for, right? To fix the reactor? Martinez and I tried to get to it, but..." she shudders. "The vents in here aren't webbed, but they're not sealed either. Every time we made noise, we heard clicking from above."
Sure enough, looking up, you see the storage bay's ceiling vents are clear of webbing but dark and open. The room has been quiet so far, but Chen's scream when you reset her shoulder was loud.
Chen struggles to her feet. "We should hurry."
What does Dax do?


### Entry 22 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dex asks chen if she can move, and what she has on her. similarly he shares what he has, and what he's experienced so far fighting one of the creatures.
he tells her of the two options they have - get the ship running and fly, or get into escape pods and ditch. knowing there's more monsters out there, dax wants to leave yesterday. but having found a survivor, he's worried about abandoning any others who might be out


### Entry 23 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Chen tests her shoulder, wincing but nodding. "I can move. Hurts like hell, but I'll manage." She pats her pockets, pulling out a few items:
"I've got a plasma torch from my engineering kit - almost dead though, maybe thirty seconds of charge left. A half-empty water bottle. And..." she produces a small data pad, "Martinez's personal log. He was tracking the creatures' movements before... before they got him."
You share your inventory with her: the sidearm (10 rounds), the cryo-foam canister, multi-tool, and dead datapad you turned into a bomb earlier. You quickly explain your encounter with the Skitterer - the fire vulnerability, how sound attracts them, the way you trapped one in the maintenance closet.
Chen's eyes widen. "You fought one alone? And survived?" She looks at you with new respect. "Martinez was military, and even he..." she trails off.
You explain the two options - fix the reactor or escape pods. Chen listens, then shakes her head.
"There are others," she says firmly. "Or there were. Dr. Yuen was alive two days ago - I heard her on the intercom trying to coordinate survivors. She mentioned gathering people in the Medical Bay, but the comms cut out. And..." she hesitates, "there's something else. Martinez suspected the Captain might still be alive on the Bridge. Sealed himself in when everything went to hell."
She looks at the Plasma Injector cabinet, then back at you. "If we fix the reactor, we get main power back. That means internal sensors, proper lighting, maybe even internal defenses. We could find other survivors easier. But if we run for the pods..." she swallows hard, "we might be leaving people to die."
The weight of command decision sits heavy. Chen adds quietly, "Whatever you decide, I'm with you. You saved my life. But Martinez kept saying - 'no one left behind.' He died believing that."
From somewhere above, very faint, you both hear a familiar sound: click... click... click...
The Skitterers know you're here.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 24 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
fuck. FUCK. dax can't bring himself to consider the escape pods any more. at least not until they can get everyone on them. he has to keep the potential of freezing the entire ship in the back of his mind, in case things turn ugly.
dax tells chen the med scanner said she was dehydrated - encourages her to take a drink. then goes for the plasma


### Entry 25 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
The moral weight settles on your shoulders. You're not leaving anyone behind if you can help it.
"Take a drink," you tell Chen firmly, gesturing to her water bottle. "Doctor's orders. Or, well, tech-scout with a medical scanner's orders."
She takes a few careful sips while you move toward the Plasma Injector cabinet. It's a standard industrial storage unit with a heavy magnetic lock - fortunately, it's on the emergency power circuit and still functional. Your multi-tool should be able to bypass it.
The clicking from above gets slightly louder. Multiple sources now - at least two, maybe three Skitterers tracking your position through the vents.
The cabinet is 5 meters away. Chen stays close behind you, her breathing controlled but tense. As you approach, you notice the floor around the cabinet has scratch marks - deep gouges in the metal, like something with claws tried to force it open but failed.
Your multi-tool has a plasma torch (for cutting), a sonic wrench (for loosening bolts), and a wire bypass tool (for electronic locks). The cabinet's lock is electronic with a manual override.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + your Intelligence modifier of +3) to efficiently bypass the lock before the Skitterers decide to drop through those vents.
The clicking is now directly overhead. Chen grips her nearly-dead plasma torch, ready to defend if needed.
What do you roll?


### Entry 26 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
I rolled 11 on a d20 +3,


### Entry 27 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Intelligence (Technology) check: 14 (Success!)
Your multi-tool's wire bypass clicks into the lock's access port. The cabinet's security is decent, but standard - you've worked with these systems before. Your fingers dance across the bypass tool's interface, rerouting power through the emergency circuit to trick the lock into thinking it received the proper authorization code.
Click-THUNK.
The magnetic seal disengages. The cabinet door swings open revealing the prize: a pristine Plasma Injector, still in its protective case. It's about the size of your forearm, a cylinder of reinforced glass containing a swirling, blue-white plasma core. Next to it sits a maintenance manual and a secondary stabilizer unit.
"Got it!" you whisper, carefully lifting the injector.
At that exact moment, a wet tearing sound comes from above. One of the vent grates is being pried open from inside. Black, viscous webbing begins to drip through the widening gap.
"Move!" Chen hisses, backing toward the ladder.
You have the Plasma Injector, but now you need to:

Get back up the ladder to Engineering (where you can install it)
Avoid or fight the Skitterers that are literally breaking through above you
Keep the fragile injector intact

The closest vent is about 4 meters away. The ladder is 10 meters. More tearing sounds indicate multiple vents are being compromised.
Chen raises her nearly-dead plasma torch. "Thirty seconds of charge. Your call - fight or run?"
What does Dax do?


### Entry 28 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax tells her we can't fight. she said herself, soldiers can't even beat them. we just have to outsmart them.
he takes the busted datapad and jagged metal and prepares to rig up another makeshift grenade. he tells chen to get ready to run for the ladder and race up it. the timing has to be just right to buy enough for them to get to the top of the ladder and seal it back


### Entry 29 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You pull out the dead datapad and jagged metal shard, your hands already working on the familiar improvisation. "We run," you tell Chen firmly. "But we need a distraction first."
Chen nods, understanding immediately. "I'll cover the ladder. Go!"
Above, a Skitterer's eyeless head pushes through the vent, antennae twitching. Then another vent tears open 3 meters to your left.
You need to puncture the datapad's battery at just the right angle to create maximum thermal discharge - you've done this once before, but under pressure with multiple threats, it'll be harder.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to successfully create another thermal grenade quickly enough.
The first Skitterer drops to the floor with a wet thud, its blade-like forelimbs clicking against the deck. It's between you and the ladder now, head swiveling as it tastes the air.
Chen backs toward the ladder, keeping her plasma torch ready but not ignited yet - saving those precious thirty seconds.
"Whatever you're doing, do it fast!" she hisses.
The second Skitterer is squeezing through its vent. You've got seconds.
What do you roll?


### Entry 30 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]

Intelligence (Technology) check: 17 (Success!)
Your hands work with practiced precision despite the chaos. You've done this once - you can do it again. The metal shard punches through the datapad's casing at the perfect angle, right into the battery's sweet spot.
The device immediately starts whining, heating up fast.
"NOW!" you shout, hurling the improvised grenade between the first Skitterer and the ladder.
The datapad detonates in mid-air with a brilliant flash and a wave of searing heat. The Skitterer shrieks, reeling back from the thermal blast, its sensitive antennae overwhelmed.
"GO GO GO!"
Chen doesn't need to be told twice. She sprints for the ladder as the second Skitterer drops from the ceiling behind you. You clutch the Plasma Injector case to your chest and bolt after her, your four legs pumping.
Chen hits the ladder first, climbing with desperate speed. You're right behind her, using your multiple arms to climb faster than any human could. Below, the first Skitterer recovers, letting out an enraged shriek. You hear its claws scraping against the ladder's metal as it starts pursuing.
"The hatch!" Chen gasps, hauling herself up onto the Engineering deck. "There's an emergency seal!"
You scramble up, the Plasma Injector secure in one arm. Below, the Skitterer is climbing fast, maybe 3 meters down and closing.
Roll a Strength check (d20 + your -1 modifier) to help Chen slam the emergency hatch seal before the Skitterer reaches you!
The creature's blade-arms are reaching up through the ladder well...
What do you roll?

Strength check: 9 (Failure!)
You and Chen both grab the heavy emergency hatch, pulling with everything you have. But it's rusted, stuck from years of disuse. The metal groans but doesn't budge fast enough.
A bladed arm shoots up through the gap, missing your leg by inches! The Skitterer's head appears at the rim, mandibles clicking furiously.
"The torch!" you shout.
Chen doesn't hesitate. She ignites her plasma torch and jams it right into the creature's face. The thirty seconds of charge she mentioned goes fast - but it's enough. The brilliant blue-white flame sears into the Skitterer's head, and it shrieks, losing its grip and tumbling back down the ladder well with a heavy crash.
The torch sputters and dies just as you both finally wrench the hatch closed, spinning the manual lock wheel.
THUNK.
You can hear angry clicking and scraping from below, but the hatch is sealed.
Chen collapses against the floor, breathing hard. "That's it. Torch is completely dead now." She looks at the Plasma Injector case in your arms. "Please tell me that thing's intact."
You check - the case protected it perfectly. The injector is undamaged.
You're back in Engineering, main deck. The reactor core looms above. The console where you need to install the injector is 20 meters away. But now you have what you need to save the ship.
Chen struggles to her feet. "What now, boss?"
What does Dax do?


### Entry 34 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
"now? now we make sure everything we do is as quiet as possible. between us we've escaped death three times now. i dunno how many lives you humans have, but vexians don't even have *this *many"
dax sneaks over to the consoles to get the plasma injector installed and running, though in a mode that runs silently at first - no sudden power-ups or the


### Entry 35 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Chen nods grimly. "Nine lives is just a saying. Pretty sure I've used most of mine today."
You both move in near-silence across Engineering, every footstep calculated. The massive reactor core hums its low, dormant song. At the main console, you carefully open the Plasma Injector case and examine the installation panel.
The reactor's injection port is accessible through a maintenance panel beneath the console. You'll need to:

Remove the shattered old injector
Install the new one
Manually restart the coolant loop
Bring the reactor online in staged increments to avoid power surges

Chen watches your back, eyes scanning the webbed vents above. "How long will this take?"
You assess the setup. "Ten minutes if nothing goes wrong. Maybe fifteen for a truly silent startup sequence."
The broken injector is a mess - crystallized plasma residue everywhere. You'll need to clean the housing before installing the new one. Your multi-tool should handle it, but working in near-darkness by console light will require precision.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to perform the delicate installation and calibration without triggering any alarms or power surges that might attract attention.
Chen whispers, "The vents have gone quiet. That's... probably not good."
What do you roll?


### Entry 36 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]

### Entry 37 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Intelligence (Technology) check: 20 (Critical Success!)
Your four hands move like a symphony of precision. This isn't just repair work - it's art.
You extract the shattered injector with delicate care, each crystallized fragment removed without a single clink. The housing is scored and carbonized, but your multi-tool's plasma torch - set to its lowest, quietest setting - cleans it perfectly.
Chen watches in amazement as you install the new Plasma Injector with movements so smooth it barely makes a whisper. The cylinder slides home with a soft, satisfying click.
Now for the masterwork: You access the reactor's startup subroutines and begin rewriting them on the fly. Instead of the standard emergency restart (loud, bright, sudden), you program a cascading slow-initialization sequence. Each system will come online individually, power ramping up in increments so gradual that the ship's acoustics won't even change.
"You're... you're programming a stealth restart," Chen whispers in awe. "I didn't even know that was possible."
The coolant loop begins cycling - not with its usual rushing whoosh, but with a gentle, barely audible flow. The reactor core's surface begins to glow, but so faintly it's like watching a sunset in extreme slow motion.
Stage 1 complete: Emergency power boosted by 15%
Stage 2 complete: Life support optimal
Stage 3 complete: Internal sensors coming online...
The console flickers with new data. You now have access to motion sensors throughout the ship. The results are... sobering:

3 Skitterers in Engineering vents (dormant)
2 Skitterers in Central Hub (active, moving)
1 unknown large biosignature in Cargo Bay
4 human life signs detected: You, Chen, one in Medical Bay (weak), one on the Bridge (stable)

Chen sees the readout. "Dr. Yuen made it to Medical. And the Captain's alive!"
Stage 4 initiating: Main power at 40% and rising slowly...
The ship is coming back to life under your hands, silent as a whisper.
What's the plan, Dax?

dax tells chen about the medbay... how he'd come from there... how there's an angry skitterer trapped between a hall of fire and... the room where dr. yuen is... dax doesn't think they have enough to get to the doctor and back, not without ruining any chance of moving forward to the


### Entry 39 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Chen's face falls as you explain the situation. The Medical Bay is cut off by fire on one side and a trapped, enraged Skitterer on the other.
"Dr. Yuen's trapped," Chen says quietly. "The sensors show she's weak. She might be injured, running out of supplies..." She runs a hand through her hair. "But you're right. We don't have the firepower to fight through multiple Skitterers. Not with 10 rounds and a cryo-foam canister."
She looks at the sensor display showing the Bridge. "The Captain has the escape pod controls. If we can reach him, we could launch a ship-wide evacuation alert, get everyone to the pods. But that means leaving Dr. Yuen alone even longer."
The reactor continues its silent climb. Stage 5 complete: Main power at 55%.
Chen studies the ship schematic. "Wait. With main power coming back, we might have options. The fire suppression systems should come online soon. We could vent the burning corridor to space if we reach the right controls. Or..." she points to a route, "there's an environmental control station one deck up. We could flood that entire section with halon gas - kills the fire, but also knocks out anyone without a mask."
The motion sensors flicker: the two Skitterers in the Central Hub are moving toward the Engineering door. They're investigating the subtle power changes.
"We need to decide fast," Chen whispers. "Dr. Yuen alone in Medical, or the Captain on the Bridge. Who do we save first?"
The weight of the decision hangs heavy. Both survivors need help. Time is running out.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 40 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax thinks back to his time in the medbay. the door to the corridor was left open, as was the vent that led to the central hub maintenance closet. he asks chen, "spacing it would mean losing the doctor to the void, no?"
either way, it's the central hub that needs immediate attention. they'll not get far with the two creatures right outside the door. but the hub... the hub *is *sealed shut. 
dax asks chen to help him find a way to space the central


### Entry 41 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You think through the geometry of the ship. The Medical Bay door was indeed left open to the burning corridor, and that maintenance tunnel you escaped through... it leads right back to the Central Hub. Spacing the Hub would create a vacuum that would pull through those connections.
Chen's eyes widen as she realizes the same thing. "Oh god, you're right. The pressure differential would suck everything through those openings. Dr. Yuen wouldn't stand a chance."
She pounds her fist against the console in frustration, then forces herself to think. "Okay, okay. The Hub is sealed from this side, you're right. But those two Skitterers..." She pulls up the environmental controls on the console. "Wait. Look at this."
The schematic shows the Central Hub's atmospheric systems. "The Hub has emergency vent hatches in the ceiling - for exactly this scenario. But they're manually operated from inside the Hub itself, or..." she traces a pathway, "from the Bridge override controls."
The motion sensors ping: the two Skitterers in the Hub have settled near the Engineering door, seemingly waiting.
"There's one other option," Chen says quietly. "The Hub has an observation window looking out into space. Port side, reinforced transparisteel. If we could somehow break it..."
She looks at you. "Your cryo-foam. If we could get it on that window, the thermal shock might crack it. But we'd need to be in the Hub to do it, with those things."
Stage 6 complete: Main power at 70%. Internal comms system now available.
A new option appears on your console: ship-wide intercom.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 42 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax tries not to panic. he recalls how important the cold is in fighting these things, reluctant to use such a useful close-combat defensive tool to blow a hole in the ship.
all the answers are in the bridge. (pause - does dax know how to get from engineering to the bridge? i


### Entry 43 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Yes! Earlier when you checked the terminal in the Central Hub, you mapped the route to the Bridge. From the Gemini logs:
The path to the Bridge from Engineering:

Exit Engineering into the Central Hub (currently blocked by 2 Skitterers)
From the Hub, take the main lift up two decks
Go through the Officer's Quarters corridor
Finally reach the Bridge

So you'd need to somehow get through or around those two Skitterers in the Hub first. The Bridge feels both tantalizingly close and impossibly far away.

You stare at the console, mind racing. The cryo-foam is too valuable to waste on breaking a window. Those creatures are vulnerable to cold - it might be your only real weapon against them.
"The Bridge has all the answers," you mutter. "Pod controls, environmental overrides, maybe even weapons systems."
Chen nods. "But those two Skitterers are literally camping our only door out."
The ship's intercom system glows ready on the console. You could try to contact the Captain or Dr. Yuen. You could also potentially use sound to lure the Skitterers somewhere else.
Stage 7 complete: Main power at 85%.
A new alert appears: "FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS: ONLINE - AWAITING COMMAND"
The system could suppress the fire in Corridor Gamma-7, but it would take 10 minutes to fully extinguish, and you'd still have the trapped Skitterer to deal with.
What does Dax do?

at the same time, dax uses the distraction to attempt to open the engineering bay door as quietly as possible. and then they both bolt for the


### Entry 45 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You take a deep breath, centering yourself. The plan is risky but solid.
"Alright. When you hit that intercom, those things are going to focus on the nearest sound source - you. Then I open the door and we run like hell."
Chen positions herself at the intercom, finger hovering over the broadcast button. "The lift is about 30 meters from the Engineering door. We'll have maybe five seconds before they recover from the surprise."
You move to the door controls, hand ready. The motion sensors show both Skitterers still lurking just outside.
"On three," you whisper. "One... two..."
"THREE!"
Chen slams the intercom button and bellows: "THEY CAN'T SEE - DON'T MAKE A SOUND!"
Her amplified voice echoes through the entire ship. On the sensors, you see both Skitterers immediately orient toward the nearest intercom speaker - on the far wall of the Hub.
Now!
Roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check (d20 + 4) to see if you can get the door open quietly while they're distracted.
The door mechanism is heavy and hasn't been maintained recently. This is the critical moment - if they hear it opening, you'll be fighting two Skitterers head-on with nowhere to run.
What do you roll?

The door mechanism groans softly as you ease it open. One of the Skitterers' head snaps toward you, antennae twitching, but Chen's amplified voice is still echoing through the Hub's speakers, creating acoustic chaos.
"RUN!" you hiss.
You and Chen burst through the door into the Central Hub. The vast chamber is dimly lit by emergency power and the ghostly flicker of the holographic star map. The two Skitterers are about 15 meters away, near the far wall, but they're already turning toward you.
You sprint for the lift, Chen right beside you. Your multiple legs give you an advantage in speed, but she's running on pure adrenaline.
The lift doors are closed. You slam into the call button. The ancient mechanism begins to respond, doors starting to part with agonizing slowness.
Behind you, the distinctive click-clack-click of Skitterer legs on metal accelerates. They're charging.
"COME ON!" Chen shouts at the lift.
The doors are halfway open. You can squeeze through, but it's tight.
Roll a Dexterity saving throw (d20 + 4) to see if you both can dive through the closing lift doors before the Skitterers reach you!
The nearest Skitterer is raising its blade-arms, maybe 5 meters away and closing fast...
What do you roll?

Dexterity saving throw: 19 (Success!)
You grab Chen with two arms while your other two push off the doorframe, launching both of you through the gap. You hit the lift floor hard, rolling as the doors continue their leisurely close.
A blade-arm slashes through the narrowing gap, missing Chen's leg by centimeters. The Skitterer slams into the doors, wedging its head partially through, mandibles snapping viciously.
Chen kicks it square in the face with her boot. "GET! BACK!"
The creature reels back just as the doors seal shut with a definitive clang.
You're both panting on the lift floor. Safe. For now.
"Deck... seven," Chen gasps, hitting the button for the Bridge level. "Officer's quarters... then Bridge."
The lift shudders and begins to rise. Through the thin walls, you can hear the frustrated shrieks of the Skitterers below, and the angry banging as they attack the lift doors.
Chen pulls herself up using the wall. "That was insane. But it worked. Your message was perfect - now the Captain and Dr. Yuen know the creatures hunt by sound."
The lift indicator shows: Deck 3... Deck 4... Deck 5...
"Dax," Chen says quietly. "The motion sensors showed something big in the Cargo Bay. Bigger than the Skitterers. What if it's between us and the Bridge?"
Deck 6... Deck 7.
DING
The doors begin to open onto the Officer's Quarters corridor. It's dark, lit only by emergency strips along the floor. The hallway stretches ahead, multiple doors on either side, leading toward a reinforced bulkhead marked "BRIDGE - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY."
The corridor appears empty. Too empty. No debris, no signs of struggle. Just pristine, waiting darkness.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 50 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax's eyes glaze over, thinking about the doctor they've left so many floors down with those creatures. his failures left them wide open access to her from all angles.

dax bolts for the door and looks for a way to hack inside, or at least to communicate with the


### Entry 51 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
The guilt hits you like a physical weight. Dr. Yuen is trapped, weak, possibly dying, and your escape route left her exposed to the creatures from multiple angles.
"We have to save her," you repeat, sprinting toward the Bridge bulkhead.
Chen runs after you. "Dax, wait—"
The Bridge door is massive, reinforced, with both electronic and manual locks. A security panel beside it glows amber - locked down. There's also an intercom grille specifically for Bridge communication.
You slam your palm on the intercom button. "Captain! This is Technical Specialist Dax Stargazer with Engineer Chen. We've restored main power. We need Bridge access NOW. Dr. Yuen is trapped in Medical with hostiles converging on her position!"
Silence.
Then, a ragged male voice crackles through: "...Stargazer? You're alive? Thank god. I'm Captain Morrison. I've... I've been monitoring the situation. The doctor's bio-signs are weakening."
"Then open this door!" you shout, already pulling out your multi-tool to attack the lock mechanism.
"I can't," Morrison's voice cracks. "Not yet. Listen to me very carefully. I'm injured. Badly. I sealed myself in here three days ago when those things overran the command deck. I've been using the last of my strength to maintain quarantine protocols, but..."
A pause. Heavy breathing.
"The cargo bay creature. It's not like the others. It's... it's growing. The sensors show it's tripled in size. If I open any bulkheads now, including this one, it could trigger the automated pathway systems. That thing could reach any part of the ship in minutes."
Chen grabs your arm. "Dax, he's right. If that thing is mobile—"
"I DON'T CARE!" You're already working on the panel, trying to find a bypass. "We're not leaving her to die!"
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to attempt to override the Bridge locks without triggering the automated systems Morrison warned about.
What do you roll?

### Entry 53 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Intelligence (Technology) check: 11 (Partial Success)
Your multi-tool sparks against the panel's inner workings. You're making progress, but these Bridge security protocols are military-grade. Sweat beads on your forehead as you work.
"Almost... almost..." You manage to bypass the first two security layers, but the third is encrypted with Captain-level authorization codes.
Morrison's voice crackles through: "Stargazer, stop! You're triggering proximity alerts. The cargo bay... oh god, it's moving. It knows someone's trying to breach secure areas."
On a small emergency display next to the door, you see a ship schematic light up. A massive red dot begins moving from the Cargo Bay, heading toward the lift shaft.
"It's climbing," Morrison whispers. "The thing is CLIMBING the lift shaft. It'll reach Deck 7 in minutes."
Chen pulls you back from the panel. "Dax, we need weapons or we need to run. NOW."
Morrison speaks again, faster now: "Listen! My override code is Zulu-Seven-Seven-Alpha-Nine. But if I open this door now, the automated systems will create a direct path from the lift to the Bridge. That thing will follow. You need to make a choice - get in here and seal yourselves with me, or lead it away from both Dr. Yuen and the Bridge."
From down the corridor behind you, you hear the lift shaft doors buckle. Something immense is forcing them apart from inside.
The Captain adds desperately: "There's an emergency weapons locker in Officer Quarters 3, halfway down the hall. Code is 7-3-5-5 - Rostova's code!"
A wet, tearing sound echoes from the lift. Something is squeezing through.
What does Dax do?

dax slams the door with all four fists in frustration. he forgets rank and process and demands that the captain do whatever he can to lockdown the medbay.

### Entry 55 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
The BANG of your four fists against reinforced steel echoes down the corridor.
"Captain, LOCK DOWN THE MEDICAL BAY NOW!" you roar, abandoning all protocol. "Whatever systems you have left - seal it!"
"I... I'm trying!" Morrison's voice crackles back. "Emergency bulkheads engaging... Medical Bay sealed. But Stargazer, her oxygen is limited now—"
You're already sprinting with Chen toward Officer Quarters 3. Behind you, something massive and wet slithers out of the lift shaft with a sound like meat being pulled apart.
Chen reaches the door first, punching in 7-3-5-5. The lock chirps green and you both pile inside.
The officer's quarters have been converted into an emergency armory. Rostova was prepared. Your eyes scan rapidly for anything useful:
COLD/LIGHT OPTIONS:

Emergency flare gun (6 magnesium flares - 2000°C burning temperature, blinding light)
Portable work lights (battery powered, extremely bright but not weaponized)
No additional cryo weapons

BALLISTIC/NOISE:

Riot shotgun (8 shells - thunderous noise, wide spread)
Two flashbang grenades (deafening blast, disorienting strobe)
Standard sidearm ammunition (30 rounds, fits your pistol)

Chen grabs the shotgun immediately. "This'll wake up the whole ship."
From the corridor, you hear a wet dragging sound getting closer. Whatever came from the cargo bay doesn't move like a Skitterer - it's massive, heavy, deliberate.
The Captain's voice crackles over the room's intercom: "Motion sensors show... oh god, it's huge. Twenty meters from your position and closing."
You have seconds to grab what you need and decide: Face this thing, or find another route?
What does Dax do?

### Entry 57 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You grab the flare gun, already calculating the destruction it could cause in this confined space full of munitions. Chen's eyes widen as she understands your plan.
"You're insane," she breathes, but she's already grabbing flashbangs.
You scan the quarters desperately. Officer accommodations are usually connected - there! A maintenance hatch in the ceiling, probably leading to the environmental systems between decks.
The wet dragging is right outside the door now. The metal actually groans under something's weight.
"Chen, up!" You boost her toward the hatch with two arms while prying at it with the others. It's stuck, painted over—
The door to the quarters begins to buckle inward. Not breaking, but melting, the metal running like wax. Through the widening gaps, you see something that makes your brain rebel.
It WAS human once. Maybe. Now it's a writhing mass of flesh and absorbed materials - bits of metal, fabric, and other organic matter all fused into a nightmare roughly three meters tall. Eyes, dozens of them, blink randomly across its surface. A mouth opens where no mouth should be.
"THE COLD MAKES IT SLOW BUT IT DOESN'T STOP IT," Morrison screams over the intercom. "ROSTOVA'S LAST NOTES - IT'S STILL SPREADING, STILL GROWING—"
The maintenance hatch finally gives way. Chen hauls herself up.
Roll a Dexterity check (d20 + 4) to grab what you need and get through the hatch before this abomination enters the room!
What do you roll?

You move like liquid lightning. In one fluid motion, you grab two more flashbangs from the rack, toss them to arm strategically around the room, and leap upward. Your multiple arms make you a natural climber - you're through the hatch in seconds.
Just as you pull your legs up, the thing surges into the room below, its bulk filling the doorway. It "looks" up with those dozens of eyes, a wet gurgling sound emanating from multiple mouths.
"NOW!" you shout.
Chen doesn't hesitate. She pulls the pins on her flashbangs and drops them through the hatch. You add the flare gun's payload - all six flares fired in rapid succession down into that ammunition-filled room.
You both scramble through the crawlspace as fast as possible. Behind you:
BANG-BANG-BANG! The flashbangs detonate.
Then the flares hit the ammunition.
The explosion is catastrophic. The entire deck shudders. A wave of heat and pressure chases you through the crawlspace, but the reinforced structure holds. You hear shrieking metal, a terrible organic screaming, and then—
Sudden decompression. The blast must have breached the hull. Emergency klaxons wail as bulkheads automatically seal.
Morrison's voice, frantic: "Hull breach, Deck 7, Section C! Emergency containment... successful. The... the creature's bio-signature is gone. It's been spaced."
You and Chen drop through another hatch into a different corridor - you're past the sealed section, closer to the Bridge.
Chen is shaking. "We... we just blew a hole in the ship."
"But we're alive," you pant. "And that thing is gone."
The Bridge door is just ahead now, and Morrison is already entering his override code from the inside.
What does Dax do?

### Entry 61 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
The Bridge door hisses open, revealing a command center bathed in emergency lighting. Captain Morrison is slumped in the command chair, his uniform soaked with blood from a deep gash across his torso. His face is pale, drawn, but his eyes are sharp with determination.
"Stargazer, Chen," he rasps. "You did it. That... abomination is gone."
You rush forward but your mind is already elsewhere. "The doctor. We need to get to Dr. Yuen NOW."
Morrison weakly gestures to the main console. "Life support shows she's still alive, but barely. The Medical Bay is sealed, limited oxygen. Maybe... thirty minutes left." He coughs, blood speckling his lips. "The fire in Gamma-7 is dying down. Fire suppression finally kicked in. But those Skitterers..."
Chen is already at the weapons locker, loading fresh shells into the shotgun. "How many between us and Medical?"
Morrison pulls up the sensor display with a shaking hand. "Two in the Central Hub still. One trapped in the maintenance closet - that's your doing, Stargazer? And... three dormant in the Engineering vents."
You check your supplies: flare gun (empty), your sidearm (10 rounds), the cryo-foam canister (unused), multi-tool. Chen has the shotgun (8 shells) and the extra ammunition.
"The escape pods," Morrison continues weakly. "I can prep them for launch from here. But I can't leave this chair. Internal bleeding. I'm not... I'm not going to make it off this ship."
Chen looks stricken. "Captain, no—"
"That's an order, Engineer." His voice gains strength. "Save Dr. Yuen. Get to the pods. I'll keep the systems running as long as I can."
The timer is ticking. Dr. Yuen has less than 30 minutes of air.
What does Dax do?

### Entry 63 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Chen takes the medical scanner and runs it over Morrison. The device confirms what you already suspected - massive internal hemorrhaging, multiple organ failure. He has maybe an hour at best.
"Captain," Chen says softly. "We could use the synth-flesh applicators, but—"
"Save them for someone who needs them," Morrison cuts her off. "I knew what I was doing when I stayed. Someone had to keep the quarantine protocols active." He manages a weak smile. "Besides, this chair has the best view in the ship."
You force yourself to focus on the route. The corridor you came through is definitely compromised - that explosion tore through Officer Quarters 3 and likely destroyed the lift shaft. You scan the Bridge's emergency schematics.
"There," you point. "Emergency access shaft behind the Bridge. It goes straight down to Deck 4, comes out near secondary cargo. From there, we can cut through to reach the Medical Bay's back entrance - the one that leads to the emergency ward."
Morrison nods. "Smart. That route bypasses the Central Hub entirely. But..." he pulls up more sensors, "you'll pass right by the main cargo hold. Where that thing came from. There might be... residue. Or worse."
Chen loads her shotgun. "Twenty-five minutes of air left for Dr. Yuen."
Something tugs at your mind when you think of her. A flash of... something. A memory just out of reach. White coat. Gentle hands checking the strange energy signature behind your temple. A soft voice saying, "Don't worry, Dax. You're going to be fine. I promise."
You shake your head. Focus.
Morrison starts typing commands. "I'm opening the emergency shaft and plotting your route. The escape pods will be primed and ready. Bay 3 is closest to Medical - I'll make sure it stays clear."
The captain looks at you both. "Whatever happens, don't come back for me. That's an order."
Behind the main command console, a panel slides open revealing a narrow vertical shaft with ladder rungs.
What does Dax do?

### Entry 65 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You turn to Morrison and offer an awkward, four-armed salute - not quite military regulation, but heartfelt. "Thank you, Captain. For... for holding the line."
Morrison returns it weakly. "Get our people home, Stargazer."
You and Chen descend into the emergency shaft. The rungs are cold under your hands, and you move quickly but carefully in the darkness. Chen follows above you, the shotgun slung across her back.
Deck 6... Deck 5... Deck 4.
The shaft opens into a utility corridor. Immediately, the smell hits you - organic, wrong, like rotting fruit mixed with ozone. The walls here have a thin film of something translucent and sticky.
"Residue," Chen whispers. "From that thing."
You move quickly, trying not to think about what you're walking through. The main cargo hold doors are sealed, but you can see through the reinforced windows - the entire bay is coated in the same organic film, with strange, pod-like growths on the walls. They pulse faintly.
"Keep moving," you mutter, that strange pull toward Medical Bay getting stronger.
Another flash of memory: Dr. Yuen's voice, clearer now. "The energy signature in your temporal lobe, Dax. It's not harmful, but it's... unusual. Like an echo of something. When you're ready, come find me. We'll figure it out together."
Twenty minutes of air left.
You reach the emergency ward entrance. Your scanner (in Chen's hands) shows Dr. Yuen's life signs are weak but stable, located in the main treatment room. The trapped Skitterer is in the maintenance closet about 30 meters away, still contained.
The ward door is sealed but responds to your multi-tool. As it hisses open, stale air rushes out.
What does Dax do?

"Let's just... not think about the cargo bay," you attempt weakly, but your voice betrays genuine concern. "Whatever was growing in there..."
Chen gives you a grim look. "Yeah. Let's focus on Dr. Yuen."
The emergency ward is a smaller medical facility, separate from the main Med Bay you woke up in. It's clearly been ransacked - supplies scattered, cabinets torn open. Someone was looking for something desperately.
You and Chen quickly search through the chaos:
Chen finds:

Oxygen mask with a portable 10-minute emergency tank
Two more stim injectors (adrenaline-based)
Surgical laser (battery nearly dead)

You discover:

IV fluid bags (still sealed)
Emergency thermal blanket
A medical log pad, still powered

The log pad's last entry is from Dr. Yuen, dated two days ago:
"Barricaded in Treatment Room 2. The infections are spreading among the survivors I'm treating. Not from wounds - from exposure to the organic matter in the cargo. It changes people. Morrison was right to maintain quarantine. If anyone reads this, DO NOT let the infected reach the escape pods."
Chen's face pales. "Infected survivors? But the sensors only show Dr. Yuen..."
Fifteen minutes of oxygen left.
From deeper in the ward, you hear a faint tapping. Rhythmic. Deliberate. Like someone knocking on glass.
Treatment Room 2 is just ahead, its observation window dark.
What does Dax do?

"scan us" dax says, intentionally trying to ignore the tapping, "and pick up everything you can. i'll do the same. we'll only need it for the doctor, scoop up whatever you can take into the next room. i'll focus on getting us in"
dax begins breaking his way into the main med

Chen quickly runs the scanner over both of you while you work on the door.
"We're clean," she reports, relief evident in her voice. "No contamination detected." She starts gathering supplies - oxygen tanks, IV bags, anything portable.
You focus on the Med Bay door. It's magnetically sealed from the emergency quarantine. Your multi-tool's plasma torch still has charge, and you start cutting through the lock mechanism.
The tapping from Treatment Room 2 gets more insistent. You don't look. Can't look. Not yet.
The lock gives way with a sharp crack. The door to the main Med Bay hisses open, and you're back where this nightmare started. The cryo-pod you woke from stands open like a mouth. The terminal you first accessed flickers weakly. And there, in the corner near the surgical suite, is Dr. Yuen.
She's alive but unconscious, slumped against the wall. An oxygen mask covers her face, connected to a depleted tank. Her medical coat is stained with blood - not all of it hers. Around her are three bodies, other crew members who didn't make it.
Chen rushes over with the emergency oxygen tank, swapping it quickly. "Ten minutes of air, then we move."
Dr. Yuen's eyes flutter open as the fresh oxygen hits. She focuses on you, and despite everything, manages a weak smile.
"Dax... knew you'd come back. The signature... behind your temple... it's a memory lock. You asked me to... to put it there. Before the mission. You knew something... something about the cargo..."
The tapping from the emergency ward has turned into pounding.
Roll a Medicine check (d20 + 1) to stabilize Dr. Yuen enough to move her to the escape pods.
What do you roll?

Medicine check: 7 (Failure)
You try to help Dr. Yuen sit up, but she cries out in pain. Your hands come away bloody - there's a deep laceration along her ribs you hadn't seen, poorly bandaged and reopened.
"Stop, stop—" she gasps. "Broken ribs too. From when the ship lurched."
Chen curses. "She can't move like this. We need to properly stabilize her or she'll bleed out before we reach the pods."
The pounding from the emergency ward intensifies. Glass cracks.
Dr. Yuen grabs your arm with surprising strength. "Dax, listen. The memory lock—you were investigating the Captain's cargo manifest. You found discrepancies. The artifacts weren't from a derelict. They were... purchased. Black market. Morrison didn't know what he was buying."
Her eyes are urgent, desperate. "The code is your employee ID backwards. 5-5-3-7. It'll unlock the memories. But Dax, you might not—"
CRASH.
The observation window in the emergency ward shatters. Through the doorway, you see shapes moving. Not Skitterers. People. But wrong. Their movements are jerky, unnatural. The infection Dr. Yuen mentioned.
"We need to move NOW," Chen says, trying to lift Dr. Yuen despite her injuries.
You have to decide:

Try to carry Dr. Yuen despite her injuries (risking further damage)
Stay and defend while properly treating her wounds
The memory unlock code is right there (5-5-3-7)... but is now the time?

Eight minutes of oxygen left.

Chen doesn't hesitate. She chambers a shell in the shotgun. "On it. Just save her!"
She moves to the doorway between the main Med Bay and the emergency ward. The first infected stumbles through - it was once a crew member, still wearing a science division uniform, but fungal growths pulse along their neck and arms. Their eyes are milky, unfocused.
BOOM! Chen's shotgun roars. The infected flies backward.
"They're still coming!" Chen shouts, chambering another round.
You turn to Dr. Yuen, forcing yourself to focus. You have proper medical supplies now. You need to clean and seal that laceration, stabilize her ribs, and get her mobile.
You grab the surgical laser (praying its battery holds), the remaining synth-flesh applicators, and get to work. Your four hands let you work efficiently - one pair cleaning the wound, the other preparing supplies.
"This is going to hurt," you warn Dr. Yuen.
"Do it," she gasps.
Roll another Medicine check (d20 + 1), but this time with advantage (roll twice, take the higher) because you have proper supplies and Chen is buying you time.
BOOM! Another shotgun blast. "Six shells left!" Chen calls out. "Whatever you're doing, do it fast! There's at least four more coming!"
The infected are moaning now, a low, harmonious sound that makes your skin crawl.
What do you roll? (Remember, roll 2d20 and take the higher result, then add 1)

### Entry 75 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Medicine check: 15 (Success!)
Your hands work with the precision of someone who fixes delicate machinery. The surgical laser sputters but holds - you quickly cauterize the worst bleeding. The synth-flesh applicator seals the wound with a thick, protective layer. You wrap her ribs with the emergency bandages, tight enough to support but not restrict breathing.
Dr. Yuen gasps as the pain medications from the med kit kick in. Color returns to her face.
BOOM! "Five shells!" Chen shouts. An infected crashes into the doorframe, reaching for her with fingers that end in fungal blooms. She smashes it back with the butt of the shotgun.
"I can move," Dr. Yuen says, gripping your arm. "Not fast, but I can move."
You help her stand, supporting her weight. She's shaky but mobile.
"Chen, we're going!" you call out.
"About time!" Chen fires another round - BOOM! "Four shells! The path to the escape pods?"
Dr. Yuen points weakly. "Back exit. Through the recovery ward. It connects to Escape Bay 3."
But then she grabs your arm tighter. "Dax, before we go - the memory lock. You need to know. The cargo... Morrison was tricked. The seller knew what they were selling. This was intentional. Someone wanted these things loose on a ship."
The infected are pushing through faster than Chen can stop them. One gets past her guard, lurching toward you with arms outstretched, mouth opening to reveal fungal growths inside.
Six minutes of oxygen remaining.
What does Dax do?

dax shoots two rounds at the infected lunging for him, emptying it. he doesn't have time to reload - he's not even sure how. he regrets not having taken weapons specialization during his tech training. he never thought he'd need to, the meatheads always knew their guns better than him anyway.

BANG! BANG!
Your shots hit center mass. The infected stumbles backward, dark fluid leaking from the wounds, but it doesn't stop. It's still coming, just slower.
"They don't drop like normal!" Chen shouts, blasting another one. "Three shells!"
You holster your empty sidearm and grip the cryo-foam canister, but as you do, your other hand moves almost involuntarily to the keypad on your belt. Dr. Yuen's urgency, the desperation in her voice...
You punch in 5-5-3-7.
The effect is immediate and overwhelming.
MEMORY RESTORED:
You're in the cargo bay three weeks ago, scanner in hand. The "artifacts" are biological pods, clearly engineered. Your scan results show manufacturer tags - Weyland Biosystems, a black market weapons dealer.
You confront Morrison in private. He's shocked, horrified. "I thought they were archaeological samples! The seller said—"
"Captain, we need to jettison these NOW."
"We can't. Company paid too much. They'd court martial me."
You argue. Then you go to Dr. Yuen. Together you plan to disable them, make them 'accidentally' unusable. But you need to hide your knowledge first, in case something goes wrong. The memory lock was your insurance policy...
The flashback ends. You're back in the present. An infected is two meters away.
"DAX!" Chen screams.
You raise the cryo-foam canister and spray. The super-cooled foam engulfs the infected, flash-freezing the fungal growths. It stops mid-lunge, frozen solid.
"The cold!" Dr. Yuen gasps. "It kills the infection! The cryo-foam—"
But you only have one canister, already half-empty. More infected are coming.
Five minutes of oxygen left.
What does Dax do?

### Entry 79 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You hurl the cryo-foam canister into the cluster of infected pushing through the doorway.
"BLAST IT!"
Chen doesn't need to be told twice. BOOM!
The canister explodes in a cloud of super-cooled foam and shrapnel. The infected caught in the blast freeze solid, their fungal growths crystallizing and shattering. The doorway is blocked by frozen bodies.
"Move! MOVE!"
You support Dr. Yuen with two arms while keeping your other two free for balance. Chen covers your retreat, walking backward with the shotgun ready. Two shells left.
You burst through the recovery ward - empty beds, dark monitors. The escape pod bay door is ahead, marked with green emergency lighting. You can hear the pods' ready signals beeping.
Behind you, crashing sounds. The frozen infected are being pushed aside by more of them.
You reach Escape Bay 3. Three pods are prepped and humming. Through the small windows, you can see stars.
"Get her in!" Chen shouts, helping you lift Dr. Yuen into the nearest pod.
As you strap the doctor in, she grabs your hand. "Dax... Weyland Biosystems. Remember that name. They did this deliberately. Someone needs to know."
Morrison's voice crackles over the intercom, weaker now: "All pods ready for launch. I'm... I'm initiating emergency separation in 60 seconds. Get in and seal up."
Chen is already climbing into the second pod. "Dax, come on!"
But you hear something. From the vents above. Clicking.
The Skitterers. They've found you.
What does Dax do?

You grab the spare ammunition clip and your multi-tool, working with desperate efficiency. The plasma torch function should generate enough heat to cook off the rounds when triggered. You wedge the clip against the bay door mechanism and set the sonic wrench to a delayed overload pulse - in 10 seconds it'll create enough vibration and heat to detonate the ammunition.
You dive into the third pod, slamming the hatch. Through the small window, you can see a Skitterer dropping from the vent just as your improvised bomb starts humming.
"CAPTAIN!" you shout into the pod's comm. "SEND US ALL TO TITAN STATION. AND... THANK YOU!"
Morrison's voice, barely a whisper now: "Titan Station. Confirmed. It's been... an honor, Stargazer. Tell them... tell them what happened here."
The multi-tool sparks. The ammunition detonates in a series of sharp cracks, sending the Skitterer reeling back.
"Emergency launch in 3... 2... 1..."
The pods fire with tremendous force, shooting you out into the void. Through your window, you watch the U.E.S. Wanderer shrink behind you. Small explosions ripple along its hull - the infected, the Skitterers, all contained within a dying ship.
In the pod's gentle emergency lighting, you can see Chen in pod 2, and Dr. Yuen in pod 1, both safely away. The vast black of space surrounds you, but for the first time in days, you feel genuinely safe.
The pod's nav computer chirps: "Course set: Titan Station. Arrival in 18 hours. Entering auto-sleep mode to preserve life support."
As the sedatives kick in, your last thought is clear: Weyland Biosystems. Someone will answer for this.

18 hours later...
The escape pod's emergency lights flicker on as the sedatives wear off. Through the small porthole, you see it: Titan Station, a massive cylindrical structure rotating slowly against Saturn's pale gold backdrop. It's a trade hub, neutral territory, corporate and government interests all mixing in an uneasy dance.
Your pod shudders as docking clamps engage. A tinny automated voice crackles: "Welcome to Titan Station. Please remain seated for security scanning."
A red beam sweeps through the pod. "Bioscan complete. No contamination detected. Survivor of U.E.S. Wanderer, please proceed to

wait one sec, pause until i say restart, just wanna work some things out
1. good ask at the end of ch1 - i don't really see this 'ending' unless dax fails so hard he kicks the bucket. it is a solo campaign so once he's dead, it's over. i think? i dunno, maybe let's leave it open to perhaps jumping into another character's shoes (e.g. if dax had stayed back on the ship in ch1, i take over chen instead for ch2).
2. along those lines, i don't mind long periods without 'action'. we had a very explosive start, which was awesome, but i also like diplomacy and politics and that kind of on-world drama too. i'm a big fan of like mass effect and the expanse novels and such (please don't start including biotics and beltalowda now lol). let's go full space opera.
3. technical question - i just realized this conversation's gonna hit a max limit, isn't it? can you bake something into the save function that's like a CLAUDE.md note to yourself for continuing it on in a new conversation? i think you can look back at previous ones, right? so you could see this one (and the artifact?) and recreate + carry

Perfect pause points! Let me address each:
1. Death & Character Switching: Absolutely! If Dax dies, we could definitely continue with Chen or Dr. Yuen's perspective. Or even introduce a new character investigating what happened. The story continues even if Dax doesn't. Makes the stakes real without ending everything.
2. Space Opera Vibes: Love it! Politics, corporate espionage, station intrigue, investigation, tense negotiations - all fantastic. We can have long stretches of detective work, relationship building, and political maneuvering. Think more DS9 than just Alien. The Weyland conspiracy is perfect for this.
3. Continuation System: Smart thinking! Let me add a save note function:D&D Solo Campaign CompanionInteractive artifact ∙ Version 31 Perfect! I've added a "Campaign Notes" section that includes:

CHAPTER 2: TITAN STATION
The security officers keep their weapons trained on you. The lead officer's voice crackles through their suit speaker again, more insistent: "Three survivors? Our scans showed... that's impossible. The Wanderer's emergency beacon indicated total atmospheric breach over 72 hours ago."
Dr. Yuen sways slightly, and Chen steadies her. "We need medical attention, not an interrogation," Chen snaps. "The doctor's injured."
The lead officer hesitates, then gestures to their team. "Lower weapons. But maintain quarantine protocol." They turn back to you. "I'm Lieutenant Commander Reeves, Titan Security. You'll be escorted to Quarantine Medical for full decontamination and debriefing. Any weapons must be surrendered now."
Chen reluctantly hands over the shotgun with its two remaining shells. You have nothing left to give - your sidearm is empty, just dead weight.

"My crew," you say firmly. "Chen and Dr. Yuen. What's their status?"
The medtech glances nervously at the Director, who raises an eyebrow but nods permission.
"The engineer - Chen - is uninjured. Elevated stress hormones, mild dehydration, but physically fine. She's... uh... being quite vocal about wanting to rejoin you." Through the window, you can see Chen gesturing emphatically at her examiner.
"Dr. Yuen is stable," the medtech continues. "Three cracked ribs, deep tissue laceration, significant blood loss - but she'll recover. We're treating her with regenerative gel. She'll need at least 48 hours of observation."
Director Holbrook clears her throat. "Your concern for your crew is admirable, Mr. Stargazer. But we have protocols. Three survivors from a ship that should have been completely vented to space? Biological hazard warnings in your emergency beacon? And now accusation

You speak for nearly twenty minutes, your voice steady and clinical. You describe the Skitterers - their blindness, their sensitivity to sound, the clicking of their chitin on metal. You detail their vulnerability to heat and how their webs burn but turn brittle when frozen.
Director Holbrook's expression shifts from skepticism to concern as you describe the infected crew members, the fungal growths, their immunity to conventional weapons. Her stylus stops moving when you describe the amalgamation - the thing that had absorbed people and materials into itself, growing, spreading.
"We improvised weapons from dead datapads," you explain, your four hands demonstrating the precise angle needed to puncture the batteries. "The thermal discharge was our only effective defense against the Skitterers."
You describe Morrison's final stand, maintaining quarantine protocols even as he bled out in the captain's chair. The medtech has stopped pretending to work, listening with rapt horror.

You feel your mandibles starting to twitch more visibly - a dead giveaway of your agitation to anyone who knows Vexian body language. Weyland is already spinning the narrative, blaming the dead crew for their own murders.
Roll a Wisdom saving throw (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to maintain your composure and not reveal that you know more than you're saying.
This is crucial - if you lose control now, you might tip your hand too early. The Director is watching you carefully, and whoever is behind that observation glass is certainly recording everything.

ative technique from your homeworld. Your mandibles still, your four hands rest calmly on the table. When you speak, your voice is perfectly level.
"Insurance claims already? The crew isn't even cold yet." You let just the right amount of disgust creep in - what any survivor would feel. "I suppose corporate efficiency doesn't pause for grief."
Director Holbrook watches you intently. "You were the ship's Tech-Scout, correct? You'd have access to cargo manifests, shipping records..."
"I had access to a lot of systems," you reply carefully. "My job was maintaining equipment, not questioning cargo. Captain Morrison handled acquisitions."
"And Morrison is conveniently dead."
The temperature in the room seems to drop. Chen's voice carries through the wall - she's shouting now, though you can't make out words.
"Captain Morrison died a hero," you say, letting real emotion color your voice. "He stayed at his post to maintain quarantine. He saved this station from infection. Convenience had nothing to do with it."
Holbrook taps her stylus against the tablet. "Mr. Stargazer, I'm going to be frank. Weyland Biosystems has significant interests on this station. They employ 300 people here. They're demanding we declare this an act of crew negligence so they can collect their insurance. But your story..." she pauses, "suggests something else."
She leans back. "What I need is proof. Documentation. Recordings. Something more than the testimony of traumatized survivors."
Behind her, the door opens. A young man in a Weyland Biosystems uniform enters, datapad in hand. "Director, Mr. Kellerman wants to know if the survivors are ready for corporate debriefing."
Your mandibles definitely twitch at that.

ions Syndicate - a mid-tier shipping and exploration company that handles cargo runs and survey missions in the outer systems. Not a huge corporation, but respectable. They have a small office here on Titan Station, probably just two or three people.
Captain Morrison reported to U.E.S. management, who would have contracted with Weyland for the "artifact" transport. U.E.S. would be liable if crew negligence is proven - their insurance would have to pay out Weyland's claim.

Director Holbrook notices your reaction to the Weyland representative. "Mr. Kellerman can wait," she says coolly. "These survivors are still in medical quarantine."
The young Weyland employee shifts uncomfortably. "Sir, Mr. Kellerman insisted—"
"And I'm insisting he wait." Her tone could freeze helium. "Out."
He retreats. Holbrook turns back to you.

She stands. "You and your crewmates will be kept in protective custody - for your safety and continued medical observation, of course. You'll have quarters in Section C. Comfortable, but monitored."
The way she says 'protective' makes it clear - you're not prisoners, but you're not exactly free either.
"One more thing, Mr. Stargazer. That memory gap you mentioned in your initial medical scan - the one from three weeks before the incident - Weyland's legal team will definitely use that against your testimony."
She heads for the door, then pauses. "If there were proof of what really happened... now would be the time to remember where it might be."

### Entry 105 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Director Holbrook pauses at the door, considering your request. "The U.E.S. representative on-station is... not what you'd expect from a company that just lost a ship and crew. But yes, I can arrange that."
She turns back, studying you with calculating eyes. "Jonathan Park. He runs the U.E.S. office here - though 'office' is generous. It's mostly a mail drop and comms relay. He'll be notified you're alive within the hour."
The medtech clears their throat. "Director, the quarantine period?"
"48 hours minimum," Holbrook confirms. "Mr. Stargazer, you'll have comm access from your quarters, but all communications will be monitored - standard quarantine protocol, you understand. Can't risk contamination spreading through the station's networks."
She means Weyland will be listening too, you realize.
"Your personal effects will be returned after decontamination," she continues. "Though I understand there isn't much. A dead scanner, an empty weapon. Nothing else?"
It's a probe, careful but clear. She's asking if you have evidence hidden somewhere.
Through the observation window, you see Chen being escorted out, flanked by two security officers. She catches your eye through the glass and taps her chest pocket twice - a subtle gesture, but clear. Martinez's data log is still with her, still hidden.
"Just what you see," you answer Holbrook. "We left with what we could carry."
"Indeed." She keys something into her tablet. "Mr. Park will contact you once you're settled. Fair warning - he's been on-station for three years without a single incident. This situation is... beyond his usual scope."
Translation: he's a bureaucrat, not equipped for corporate warfare against Weyland.
The door hisses open again. "Medical will finish your examination. Welcome to Titan Station, Mr. Stargazer. Try not to cause the kind of trouble that follows survival stories."
What does Dax do?

### Entry 107 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
(Got it - I'll keep things frozen until you decide what to do. Here's the clarification:)
Current situation:

You're still in the medical examination room with the medtech
Director Holbrook just left
Chen has been escorted out by security (you saw her through the window)
Dr. Yuen is still being treated in another room

Where you're headed:

After medical finishes examining you, you'll be taken to "quarters in Section C"
These are quarantine quarters - comfortable but monitored rooms where you'll spend the mandatory 48-hour observation period
You'll have comm access but all communications will be monitored
It's "protective custody" - not quite prison, but you can't leave freely

The three of you will likely have separate quarters but in the same section. Think of it like a medical isolation ward crossed with a decent hotel - private rooms, basic amenities, but locked doors and cameras everywhere.


### Entry 108 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
as dax leaves and is escorted to the section C quarters, he examines his surroundings extremely carefully and intently to gauge exactly how much influence weyland has on this


### Entry 109 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
(Understood - no story progression on OOC questions. Let me describe what Dax observes:)
The medtech finishes their scans and two security officers arrive to escort you. As you walk through Titan Station's corridors, your trained eye catalogues everything:
Corporate Presence Visible:

Wall displays cycle through advertisements - about 1 in 5 are Weyland Biosystems (biomedical supplies, "frontier development solutions," mining equipment)
Directory signs list companies: Sakura Industries seems biggest (they have a whole section), Kepler Mining Consortium is prominent, Weyland has a modest office suite on Level 7
Security uniforms have Titan Station patches, not corporate logos - station security, not private
Maintenance crews wear station colors too

Power Dynamics You Notice:

The security officers escort you past a Weyland office branch; the corporate workers barely glance up - they don't seem to have special authority
A Sakura Industries exec argues with station security at a checkpoint and loses, having to submit to scanning
Port workers loading cargo wear different company logos but all answer to station dock authorities
Emergency protocols posted everywhere are signed by "Titan Station Authority" not any corporation

The Layout:

Section C (quarantine) is in the station's inner ring - prime real estate, suggesting the station takes quarantine seriously
Weyland's offices are mid-ring, not the prestigious outer ring with views of Saturn
The Administrator's offices you passed earlier were central, upper level - the seat of real power

Your Assessment:
Weyland has money and influence here, but they're one of several corporate players, not the boss. The station itself maintains independence. Director Holbrook runs things, and she doesn't seem to be in anyone's pocket - yet.
The quarters door looms ahead.
What does Dax do?

(prolly should have been a wisdom roll lol but i appreciate it)dax is relieved to see that titan station is not one that has been overridden with corporate influence - *yet. *he notes the location of the weyland offices as he passes, sure that he'll be returning there in one capacity or another before this is over.

### Entry 111 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
(Yeah, a Wisdom/Perception roll would've been appropriate there - good catch!)
The security officers lead you into Section C. The corridor here is different from the industrial grey of the docking area - warmer lighting, actual color on the walls (a calming blue-green), even some plants in wall-mounted containers. It's designed to be less threatening, but the cameras in every corner and the mag-locked doors remind you what this really is.
"Room C-7," one officer says, keying open a door. "Your personal effects will be delivered after decontamination. Food service is automated - use the panel. Comms are on the desk. Any medical emergency, hit the red button."
The room is... nice, actually. A bed sized for various species (it'll accommodate your Vexian frame), a small workspace with a communications terminal, a viewport showing Saturn's rings in the distance. There's even a beverage dispenser - coffee, tea, various other options.
"Your crewmates are in C-5 and C-9," the officer adds. "No physical contact during quarantine, but you can use internal comms. Quarantine lifts in 48 hours assuming no contamination signs."
They leave, and the door seals with a soft hiss. You're alone for the first time in days.
The comms terminal is already blinking with a message indicator. The screen shows:

### Entry 114 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
(OOC World Lore - what Dax knows as a regular spacer:)
The Setting:

The year is 2387, humanity reached the stars about 150 years ago
Still in the Milky Way - no extragalactic travel yet
FTL exists but it's expensive and takes time (days/weeks between systems)
Saturn's moons like Titan are "core worlds" now - safe, established, civilized
The real frontier is beyond the outer planets

Alien Contact:

First Contact happened 87 years ago with the Vexians (your people)
Vexians were already spacefaring when humans met them
About a dozen known sapient species now, mostly peaceful trade relations
No "Federation" - just treaties, trade agreements, and neutral stations like Titan
Some species are older/more advanced, but no one has overwhelming tech superiority

Your People (Vexians):

Come from a low-gravity world with lots of caves/underground cities
Four arms evolved for climbing/navigating complex 3D environments
Naturally good with tech and spatial reasoning
Maybe 2-3

### Entry 117 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You key in C-5 first. The screen shows "CHEN, M. - CONNECTED"
Chen's face appears immediately, like she was waiting by the terminal. "Dax! Finally! They've had me in this box for twenty minutes already. You okay? What did the Director ask you?"
Before you can answer, she leans closer to the camera and mouths silently: "Still have it." She taps her chest - Martinez's data log.
You toggle to C-9. "YUEN, S. - NO RESPONSE"
Makes sense - she's probably still in medical treatment, sedated for the rib work.
Chen's voice comes through again: "Dax, I've been thinking. That Weyland rep who showed up during your debrief? They were awfully quick to get here. Like they were waiting for us."
She's right. The Wanderer only docked maybe an hour ago, but Weyland already had insurance claims filed and a representative demanding access to survivors.
The comms terminal blinks again - J.PARK's message is still waiting.
Chen adds: "Oh, and our U.E.S. rep already messaged me. Jonathan Park. Sounds... nervous. Really nervous."
What does Dax do?

SUBJECT: Condolences and Administrative Matters
Mr. Stargazer,
First, my deepest condolences on the loss of the U.E.S. Wanderer and her crew. Captain Morrison was a valued member of the U.E.S. family.
I have been informed of your survival along with Engineer Chen and Dr. Yuen. This is... unexpected but welcome news.
There are several administrative matters requiring attention:

Survivor benefits paperwork
Standard incident debriefing for U.E.S. records
Coordination with insurance investigators
Next-of-kin notifications for deceased crew

I understand you are in mandatory quarantine for 48 hours. I will visit as soon as permitted. In the meantime, Weyland Biosystems has requested copies of all crew logs and records. As your U.E.S. representative, I must advise you that you are NOT obligated to provide these without legal counsel present.
Please rest and recover. We will handle the formalities when you are ready.
Regards,
Jonathan Park

P.S. - The main office has asked me to determine if any backup data cores were recovered. Standard procedure would have been to eject them before abandoning ship. Please advise at your earliest convenience.

That postscript is interesting. Is he fishing for evidence, or hinting that you should have some?
What does Dax do?


### Entry 122 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax is annoyed with himself. the backups. it wasn't his fault, the memory blocker was still active while he was on the bridge. the captain never mentioned it either, but... he was in no state to think corporate.dax heads to a mirror, splashes his face and begins to practice his spiel for the debrief. largely the same information he went over with the director, but with more detail about the captain and the other crew they saw while there.
he considers how much he should say about weyland, but remembers the conversation will be being watched. he'll need to articulate so he's not lying, and so that he can fill in the gaps about weyland later.he also considers survivor benefits. this is no time to take a corp apartment on titan and rest up. he needs to get back out there - this is no mystery that'll be solved on titan alone. he wonders if the benefits could get him a modest ship instead. he could take on small shipping requests to make some cash while focusing on his true mission. on... 


### Entry 123 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
The mirror shows a tired Vexian face - your mandibles slightly drooped, your compound eyes dulled from stress. The cold water helps, though it's strange on your chitinous features compared to human skin.
You run through the story again, rehearsing. Morrison's heroism. The crew you couldn't save. The "artifacts" with no further detail. The quarantine he maintained. Each word carefully true but incomplete. You can fill the gaps later when you're not being recorded by who-knows-how-many parties.
The survivor benefits... standard U.E.S. package would be:

Three months salary continuation
Trauma counseling (which you'll definitely refuse)
Temporary housing on any U.E.S.-affiliated station
OR a lump sum of about 15,000 Universal


### Entry 124 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s

That lump sum... it's not enough for a ship. Not even close. Even a rusty single-berth courier would run 50,000 minimum. But if Chen and Yuen pooled their benefits too - 45,000


### Entry 125 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s. Add in whatever savings you each have...
You think about Chen. She'd spent three years on the Wanderer, worked her way up from junior engineer. She's got the temperament for command when she's not running hot. And she's already proven she can handle herself in crisis.
Dr. Yuen... she knows more than she's said. That comment about you asking her to place the memory lock - that suggests you trusted her three weeks ago with dangerous knowledge. A ship's doctor who can keep secrets might be invaluable.
But would they follow you on what might be a revenge quest disguised as justice?
The comms terminal chimes. New message from C-5 (Chen): "Dax, I get it. Wrong time. But we need to sync our stories before official debrief. 47 hours to get it right."
She got your message about surveillance. Smart.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 126 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax goes over what he'd practiced in the mirror, making sure to earnestly fill in bits he'd forgotten with chen's knowledge of events. to anyone listening in, it wouldn't sound like conspiracy, just two survivors helping each others memories.
the gaps regarding weyland are, hopefully, picked up on by chen as being intentional, and are left as mysteries for


### Entry 127 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You open the comm to Chen, keeping your voice steady and professional. "Chen, you're right. We should go over the timeline. Make sure we have everything straight."
"Yeah," she says, catching your tone immediately. "Let's start from when you woke up in Medical."
You methodically walk through the events. The cryo-pod malfunction. The damaged ship. Finding the logs about an "unidentified biological signature in the cargo bay." You describe the Skitterers in detail, the infected crew, the amalgamation creature.
"The Captain mentioned he'd acquired some artifacts for transport," you say carefully. "But he never told us the specifics. Just cargo, as far as we knew."
Chen nods slowly on screen. "Right. Morrison handled all acquisitions. We just... transported things." Her voice is perfectly neutral. She's caught on.
You continue through the story - Rostova's sacrifice, the armory code 7355, the plasma injector repair, Morrison's final stand.
"The cargo bay was covered in that organic residue," Chen adds. "Whatever was in those containers, it got out. Poor containment? Damaged in transit? Who knows."
"Who knows," you agree.
You both carefully review each crew member you encountered, living and dead. The story is complete, consistent, and thoroughly missing any mention of your recovered memories or Martinez's data log.
"I think we have it straight," Chen finally says. "Same story for the U.E.S. debrief tomorrow."
"Agreed. Get some rest, Chen."
She gives you a long look through the screen. "You too, Dax. We're going to need our strength for whatever comes next."
The call ends. Your story is synchronized. The official version, anyway.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 128 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax is exhausted. but there's something left on his mind. who was handling cargo on the ship? he'd been by to help with some checks and repairs, sure, but he wasn't a cargo worker.
he looks around for something that might help him investigate, one more piece of the puzzle before he turns


### Entry 129 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You pace the small quarters, your mind churning. The cargo manifests. Someone had to handle the physical loading, sign off on the containers, supervise the storage...
The room's comm terminal has basic station directory access. You search for U.E.S. Wanderer crew records - they're part of the incident report, technically public within the investigation.
The manifest appears:

Captain Morrison - commanded acquisitions
Cargo Chief Ramirez - killed first, Chen mentioned
Loading Supervisor Martinez - Chen has his data log
Cargo Specialist Yuen, D. -

Wait. Yuen, D.
Not ship's doctor. Dr. Yuen was listed as Cargo Specialist with medical certification. She'd have been responsible for biological cargo, anything requiring special environmental controls. She'd have signed off on those containers.
Your memory flashes - three weeks ago, going to her about the suspicious manifests. She'd helped you, yes, but she'd also have been the one who cleared those "artifacts" for storage in the first place.
Another piece clicks. Her insistence in the Med Bay about telling you the memory lock code, even while injured and low on oxygen. Her knowledge that the Captain was tricked. She knew because she'd have been part of the acquisition process.
The terminal blinks with another update - Dr. Yuen's status has changed to "Conscious - Restricted Communication per Medical Protocol."
She's awake. And she has a lot more to explain than just your memory lock.
You're exhausted, running on fumes, but this revelation sits heavy in your mind.

You send a brief message to Dr. Yuen: "Glad you're recovering. Rest well. We'll speak in the morning."
The quarters' lights dim automatically as you move toward the bed, adjusting to Vexian preferences - softer, more amber than the harsh white humans prefer.
You perform your evening khett-sa, the


### Entry 132 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
ative stretching routine your people developed in the low-gravity caverns of home. Each of your four arms extends in sequence, chitinous joints clicking softly as you work out the tension of the last few days. It's the first time you've had space and privacy for the ritual since before... everything.
You clean your mandibles with the provided hygiene kit (thankfully, Titan Station stocks multi-species supplies), and run a damp cloth over your compound eyes - they've been dry and irritated from all the recycled ship air and smoke.
The bed is surprisingly comfortable, with adjustments for various anatomies. You arrange yourself in the Vexian sleeping position - lower arms folded beneath you, upper arms free (an evolutionary holdover from when your ancestors needed to be ready to catch themselves if they fell from cave walls during sleep).
As exhaustion finally claims you, your mind churns with questions. Yuen's cargo role. Martinez's data. Weyland's timing. The Director's careful prob

(let's save and readjust the artefact!)
ooc question, what species' are chen and yuen? i think dax called one of them human earlier but that might just have been me assuming. dax probably wouldn't know their back stories ( maybe yuen, but he doesn't quite remember), but he can see them


### Entry 134 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
(OOC: Good question! I actually haven't specified their species - let me establish that now:
Chen is human - fairly typical spacer stock, probably from one of the asteroid colonies based on her engineering background. Dark hair, compact build from growing up in artificial gravity, maybe early 30s.
Dr. Yuen is also human, but likely from one of the core worlds given her medical training and dual specialization. More polished than typical frontier crew. Maybe late 30s, early 40s.
Humans still make up about 60-70% of most crews since human companies like U.E.S. tend to hire their own species preferentially (not policy, just unconscious bias). Dax being Vexian made him a bit of an outsider on the crew, though his technical skills spoke for themselves.
You're right that Dax wouldn't know their full backstories yet, especially with the memory lock having been in place. He'd know Chen has been on the ship for 3 years and worked her way up. Yuen... well, he's just discovering she wasn't qu


### Entry 135 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
one piece of feedback - i don't think we had a single roll during day 1 lol. let's not just have rolls for action - stuff like dax looking for weyland influence, chen picking up on the surveillance vibes. i'll often  nudge as well by saying like "dax tries to", "attempts to", "hopes that"


### Entry 136 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You're absolutely right! Day 1 was way too smooth - I should have been calling for rolls during the investigation and social moments. Good catches on where rolls should have happened:

Dax examining the station for Weyland influence: Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation)
Chen picking up surveillance hints: Wisdom (Insight)
Dax trying to stay calm with the Director: We did roll that one at least!
Maybe even Dax recognizing Yuen's cargo role: Intelligence (Investigation)

I'll be much better about calling for rolls during non-combat scenes. Social encounters, investigation, noticing details, trying to deceive or persuade - all need rolls to add tension and uncertainty. The dice should be part of the storytelling, not just the action scenes.
And yes, I'll watch for those verbal cues - "tries to," "attempts to," "hopes that" are all perfect indicators that you want to roll for something.
Thanks for the feedback! When we pick up with Day 2, expect a lot more skill che

### Entry 138 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
In D&D 5e (which we're loosely using), stats are usually locked in at character creation. BUT! There are a few common ways DMs handle improvement:
Standard Options:

Ability Score Improvements (ASI) - Every 4 levels, you can add +2 to one stat or +1 to two stats (can't go above 20)
Feats - Sometimes instead of ASI, you can take a feat that might give +1 to a stat plus other benefits
Magic items - Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Headband of Intellect, etc.

Training (Optional Rule):
Some DMs allow downtime training - like spending weeks/months and


### Entry 139 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s to improve a weak stat by 1. Makes narrative sense that Dax could hit the gym during long space flights to get that STR from -1 to 0.
My Suggestion for Our Game:

Every 2-3 "chapters" (major story arcs), you get an ASI
Training during downtime costs


### Entry 140 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s and time (like 30 days and 1000


### Entry 141 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s to raise a stat by 1, max once per stat)
Story moments might grant improvements (like if you do lots of diplomacy, maybe earn +1 CHA)

So yeah, Dax could eventually get less terrible at strength or more charismatic, but it'll take time and effort. Sound good? We can keep it flexible and story-driven rather than strict XP tracking.
What feels right for the campaign to you?

DAY 2 - TITAN STATION QUARANTINE
You wake to the soft chime of the quarters' alarm. 0700 station time. Your compound eyes adjust to the rising lights, taking in Saturn's pale gold through the viewport.
Your body feels better - the first real rest you've had in days. The khett-sa stretches helped, though your lower left arm is sore from all that ladder climbing on the Wanderer.
The comm terminal shows:

3 new messages from J. Park
1 message from Dr. Yuen
System Notice: Debrief scheduled 0900 with U.E.S. Representative

Dr. Yuen's message is simple: "We need to talk. Before the debrief. Please."
Park's messages are increasingly nervous reminders about documentation, procedures, and "the importance of accurate record-keeping."
The beverage dispenser hums invitingly. The Vexian equivalent of coffee - a warm, slightly acidic brew from your homeworld - might help clear your head.
You have two hours before the official debrief. Time to figure out if you can trust Dr. Yuen with what you know, or if she's been playing you from the start.
Roll a Wisdom (Insight) check (d20 + 1) to see if you can read between the lines of Yuen's message - is her urgency desperation or manipulation?
What do you roll?

### Entry 145 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Wisdom (Insight) check: 18 (Success!)
Reading the message again, you parse the subtext. The punctuation, the timing, the simple directness - this isn't manipulation. This is someone who's been carrying guilt and needs to confess before they lose their nerve.
She sent it at 0400 station time. She's been awake all night wrestling with this.
The "Before the debrief" is key - she wants to come clean to you before the official story gets locked in. Someone planning to manipulate you would wait until after, see what you say officially first.
You grab your Vexian coffee - bitter and sharp, perfect for cutting through the morning fog - and open a comm to C-9.
Dr. Yuen appears on screen immediately. She looks exhausted despite the medical treatment, dark circles under her eyes. The regenerative gel has closed her wounds, but her expression shows a different kind of pain.
"Dax," she starts, then stops. Swallows. "I know you've figured it out. Cargo Specialist. I... I signed off on those containers. The manifests said archaeological specimens. Inert biological samples. Morrison trusted my assessment."
She's not looking at the camera, staring at something off-screen.
"Three weeks ago, when you came to me with your suspicions, I should have admitted it then. But I was scared. Scared I'd been fooled. Scared I'd killed us all through incompetence." Her voice cracks slightly. "Then you asked me to help with the memory lock, and I thought... maybe if we could prove Weyland lied, it wouldn't be my fault."
She finally looks directly at you. "I need you to know everything before Park gets here. Before we're on record."
What does Dax do?


### Entry 146 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax is frustrated, disappointed. he'd be angry if he had the capacity for it - he was never one to succumb to a base instinct like rage. yuen has spilled it all, with god-knows-who listening.
he doesn't blame her for her part in bringing those things onto the ship. but her desperation has shown their hand, and now he and chen look like liars from their conversation the day before.
... unless... surprise... he has to act surprised. like he didn't know any of this. chen will get it, she always does.
dax thanks yuen for plugging the gaps in information. he suggests they bring chen in on this call, so she can learn this "new" context


### Entry 147 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Your mandibles tighten - the Vexian equivalent of a clenched jaw - as you process what just happened. Yuen just confessed to signing off on the cargo over monitored comms. Whoever's listening now knows you and Chen held back information yesterday.
But you force surprise into your voice, playing the only card you have: "You... you signed off on them? Dr. Yuen, I had no idea you were cargo specialist. This changes..." you pause, as if processing. "This changes everything. Chen needs to hear this."
You can see Yuen's confusion at your formal tone, but you push forward, adding Chen to the call.
Chen's face appears, still groggy. "What's going—"
"Chen, Dr. Yuen just informed me she was actually the cargo specialist. She signed off on those containers." You put just enough shock in your voice for the recording.
Chen's eyes sharpen instantly, reading the situation. "What? Doc, you were... but you never said anything on the ship."
"I know," Yuen says miserably. "I was scared. When everything went wrong, I—"
"You should have told us immediately," Chen cuts in, playing her part perfectly. "We've been trying to piece together what happened, and you had critical information this whole time?"

Your acting is stiff, unconvincing. The surprise in your voice sounds hollow even to your own ears - like someone reading from a script they just received.
There's a long pause. Then Yuen's expression changes. Not confusion anymore, but a dawning realization.
"You... you already knew," she says quietly. "Both of you knew."
Chen drops the act immediately. "Doc—"
"No, I get it," Yuen interrupts. "Monitored comms. You were protecting the information. And I just..." She puts her head in her hands. "I just blew it all over an open channel."
The damage is done. Whoever's listening - Weyland, the Director, station security - now knows:

Yuen was responsible for clearing the cargo
You and Chen discovered this information but hid it
You're actively coordinating your stories

A notification pops up on your screen: "Director Holbrook requests your presence. Escort arriving in 5 minutes."
Chen curses. "So much for waiting until 0900."
Yuen looks devastated. "Dax, I'm sorry. I thought... I thought being honest would help. I didn't think about—"
"We adapt," you cut in. No point in recriminations now. "Chen, stick to the story we discussed but be ready to adjust. Yuen, tell them everything about the cargo, but nothing about the memory lock unless directly asked."
The door chime sounds. Your escort is here.
The game has changed. Time to face the Director with your cards partially revealed.

The security officers are polite but firm. "Mr. Stargazer, the Director requests your immediate presence."
As you walk through the station corridors, you notice more activity than yesterday. Workers pause to stare - word of the Wanderer survivors has spread. You catch whispers: "...only three survived..." "...some kind of infection..." "...Weyland's furious..."
The Director's office is high in the station's central spire. Floor-to-ceiling windows show Saturn's rings in breathtaking detail. Holbrook stands with her back to you, hands clasped behind her.
"Mr. Stargazer. Please sit."
She turns, and her expression isn't angry - it's calculating.
"That was quite the performance this morning. Unfortunately for you, I've been running this station for twelve years. I know bad acting when I hear it."
She sits across from you, placing a tablet on the desk between you. On it, a waveform analysis of your conversation.
"Your stress patterns spiked when Dr. Yuen started talking. Chen's response time was too quick - she was ready for the revelation. You've been coordinating."
She leans back. "Here's what I know: Three survivors from an impossible situation. One turns out to be the cargo specialist who approved the containers. You two knew this but tried to hide it. Why?"
Her eyes are sharp. "I have Weyland breathing down my neck, demanding access to you. I have U.E.S. sending increasingly panicked messages. And I have three survivors who are clearly hiding something bigger than procedural failures."
She stands, moving to the window. "I don't like Weyland, Mr. Stargazer. They throw their weight around, assume

You study her body language, the micro-expressions that even experienced politicians can't fully hide. The way she said "I don't like Weyland" - there was genuine distaste there, maybe even history. The tension in her shoulders when she mentioned them breathing down her neck.
But more telling is what she's not doing. She hasn't called in Weyland's rep. She brought you here alone, no security recording, no legal witnesses. She's giving you a chance to come clean in private.
And that comment about "twelve years running this station" - there's pride there. This is her station. Weyland is just a tenant, and an annoying one at that.
She's fishing for information, yes, but she's also genuinely willing to help if you give her ammunition to work with. She needs something concrete to justify protecting you from Weyland. She's a political creature, but not a corporate puppet.

"Three weeks before the incident, I scanned unusual manifest discrepancies. The 'archaeological specimens' had Weyland Biosystems manufacturing tags embedded in their shipping codes. Black market bioweapon indicators. I confronted Morrison - he was genuinely shocked. He'd been sold these as legitimate artifacts."
Holbrook's expression doesn't change, but she's listening intently.
"I went to Dr. Yuen to verify my findings. We planned to document everything, but I was paranoid about corporate retaliation. I had Yuen place a memory lock on me - insurance in case something went wrong. The code was 5-5-3-7, my employee ID reversed."
You continue, "When everything went to hell, I recovered those memories during our escape. But that's just my word. However..." you lean forward, "Chen has Martinez's data log hidden on her person. Martinez was tracking creature movements, documenting the outbreak. And my medical scanner has bio

The room goes silent except for the hum of the station's life support. Holbrook stares at you for a long moment, then something shifts in her expression. Decision crystallizing into action.
She stands and walks to a wall panel, pressing her palm against it. A hidden compartment opens, revealing a secure terminal.
"Computer, activate Protocol Seven. Director's Override. All Weyland Biosystems assets on Titan Station are hereby frozen pending investigation of corporate terrorism charges. Security teams to Weyland offices immediately. No communications in or out."
She turns back to you. "Done. As of this moment, you and your crew are under my personal protection as material witnesses in a capital case."
The door chimes. Chen enters, escorted by security, looking worried. "Director, what—"
"Your data log, Engineer. Now."
Chen hesitates, then pulls Martinez's log from an inner pocket. Holbrook slots it into her terminal immediately. D

Her comm buzzes. "Director, Weyland's office is... resisting. Mr. Kellerman is demanding to speak with you."
"Tell Mr. Kellerman he can speak to me after his arrest. Charge him with obstruction if he continues to resist."
She turns back to you. "You've given me everything I need to bury them, but they'll fight back. They'll claim the evidence is fabricated, that you're disgruntled survivors looking for someone to blame. We need more."
"The memory lock," she muses. "If we could get a neural scan showing the tampered memories, proving you hid this information before the incident..."
She smiles, and it's sharp as a blade. "Mr. Stargazer, how would you like to help me destroy Weyland Biosystems?"

"With pleasure," you reply. "Whatever it takes."
"First things first," you continue. "We need secure quarters where my crew can actually communicate. I understand station security needs to monitor us - that's fine, I trust your people. But no more corporate ears, no more wondering who else is listening."
Holbrook nods. "Done. I'll move you to Section A - diplomatic quarters. My security team monitors those directly, no external feeds. You'll have privacy from everyone except my most trusted staff."
Chen shifts uncomfortably. "Director, Dr. Yuen isn't here. She needs to know what's happening."
"She's being briefed now," Holbrook replies. "My medical chief is with her. She'll be moved to join you once she's stable enough."
The Director pulls up a holographic display of the station. "Here's what I need from you. Weyland's local operations are frozen, but their corporate headquarters on Europa will respond within 48 hours. They'll send lawyers, private security, maybe worse. Before that happens, we need to build an airtight case."
She highlights several locations on the map. "First, we need that neural scan of your memory lock - my medical team can do that. Second, I want you to work with my investigators to create a complete timeline. Every detail, every crew member, every piece of evidence."
"But here's the real play," she leans forward. "Kellerman doesn't know you've talked to me yet. He thinks you're still in quarantine, still accessible. I want to let him think that. When he reaches out - and he will - you record everything. Let him incriminate himself."
Chen grins darkly. "You want us to be bait."
"I want you to be justice," Holbrook corrects. "Twenty-three people are dead. Someone at Weyland made that decision. I want to know who."
A thought occurs to you. "Director, the Wanderer's black box. Emergency data core. It would have automatically ejected before the ship was lost. If we could retrieve it..."
Her eyes sharpen. "That would have everything. Logs

Your mind goes completely blank. The emergency procedures, the ejection protocols, the orbital mechanics - it all turns to static in your head. The stress of the past few days, the memory lock, the lack of sleep - it all crashes down at once.
"I... I can't remember," you admit, frustrated. "The black box would have ejected when Morrison initiated final protocols, but the trajectory..." You rub your compound eyes with one hand. "It's gone. I can't calculate it."
Chen steps in. "Standard protocol is ejection perpendicular to ship's trajectory. The Wanderer was in Saturn's orbit, so—"
"That's a search area of millions of cubic kilometers," Holbrook interrupts. "Without precise calculations, it could take weeks to find. And Weyland probably has the ship's last telemetry data from their insurance claim."
She thinks for a moment. "We'll have to work with what we have. The evidence here is strong, but that black box would be the killing blow." She taps her terminal. "I'll dispatch a recovery team to search, but don't count on it."
A notification appears on her screen. "Speaking of Weyland, Mr. Kellerman is demanding his comm access be restored. He wants to speak with the survivors." She looks at you. "Ready to play bait? Remember, he doesn't know you've given me the evidence yet."
"Director," Chen says, "what about Park? Our U.E.S. rep? He's supposed to debrief us this morning."
"Mr. Park can wait. This takes priority." Holbrook stands. "I'll have you moved to Section A within the hour. Get some rest, then we'll set up the call with Kellerman. Make him think you're still scared, isolated survivors. Let him make his threats or his bribes."
She pauses at the door. "Oh, and Mr. Stargazer? That memory of yours better come back. We might need those calculations yet."

Your four fists clench in frustration. "I KNOW this information. Morrison drilled emergency procedures into everyone. But it's just... gone." You slam one hand on the table, making Chen jump.
"Easy, Dax," she says. "We've been through hell. Your brain's probably protecting you from—"
"My brain is failing when we need it most," you cut her off, then immediately regret your tone. "Sorry. I just..."
Chen waves it off. "Look, about Kellerman - I'm an engineer, not a con artist. I can try to lead, but..." she grimaces. "Remember when I tried to bluff those inspectors about the coolant leak last year? Morrison had to step in before I got us all fined."
You manage a weak laugh despite everything. "You told them it was 'supposed to be that color.'"
"Green coolant in a system that uses blue. Yeah, not my finest moment." She sobers. "But we don't have a choice. We have to try."
"Together then," you say. "Play up the trauma. We're scared survivors who just want this over with."

Looking at Dr. Yuen, you see past the wheelchair and the medical monitors. Her hands are steady. Her breathing is controlled despite the pain medication. Most importantly, her eyes have a clarity that wasn't there this morning - the confusion and guilt have crystallized into determination.
She's not just stable; she's focused. The guilt is driving her, but not clouding her judgment. If anything, she might be your best asset here - Kellerman won't expect the "guilty" cargo specialist to be working against him.
"You're ready," you tell her. "But we need a plan. Kellerman will try to divide us, use your guilt against you."
"Let him," Yuen says firmly. "I did sign those containers. That part's true. But I was deceived, and I have the certification logs to prove the containers were sealed and labeled as inert specimens. The fraud was on Weyland's end."
Chen nods. "So we stick to partial truths. We're scared, we want this over, but we don't volunteer anything."
Director Holbrook re-enters. "Your new quarters are ready. Section A, diplomatic wing. My personal security chief, Commander Torres, will oversee your protection. She's... thorough."
She hands you a secure comm unit. "This links directly to my office. Use it if Kellerman crosses any lines. And remember - he's going to try to isolate you, make individual deals. Don't let him."
The three of you are escorted to Section A. The difference is immediate - real windows, a common area where you can meet, individual rooms that connect. It feels less like a prison and more like a safe house.
An hour later, the comm terminal chimes.

"Remember," you say quietly, "we're scared survivors who want this over. The truth about Weyland is only for the Director. Nothing about memory locks, nothing about what we knew before."
Chen and Yuen nod. You accept the call.
The screen fills with a man in an expensive suit - mid-40s, sharp features, predator's smile. Behind him, a pristine office with Weyland's logo prominent.
"Survivors of the Wanderer," Kellerman begins, voice smooth as oil. "I'm James Kellerman, Senior Liaison for Weyland Biosystems. First, let me express our deepest condolences for your ordeal and the loss of your colleagues."
He doesn't wait for a response. "I understand there's been some confusion about the cargo we contracted with Captain Morrison. Very tragic how improper handling led to such catastrophic results."
The accusation hangs there, baited hook.
Dr. Yuen shifts in her wheelchair. Chen's jaw tightens.
"We're reviewing the incident for our insurance claim," Kellerman continues. "However, we've noticed some... discrepancies in your initial statements to Station Security. Different versions of events. Memory gaps." His eyes find you specifically. "Mr. Stargazer, your medical scan showed neurological anomalies. That must be concerning."
He leans forward. "Weyland values truth. We're prepared to offer substantial compensation - enough to set you up for life - in exchange for accurate testimony about Captain Morrison's negligence in handling our legitimate archaeological specimens."

You catch the surface-level threat clearly enough - he knows about your memory anomaly and he's dangling money versus the implied threat of using your "unreliable" testimony against you. But there's something else underneath his smooth delivery that you can't quite parse.
The compensation offer is obvious bribery. The threat about "discrepancies" is meant to make you doubt yourselves. But why is he so confident? He's acting like he holds cards you don't know about.
Chen speaks first, voice carefully controlled. "Mr. Kellerman, we've been through severe trauma. Of course our initial statements might have gaps. We watched our friends die."
"Of course, of course," Kellerman says smoothly. "Trauma can affect memory. Make people... misremember things. Even believe things that didn't happen. Expert witnesses would testify to that."
There it is - he'd paint you as delusional if needed.
Dr. Yuen leans forward slightly. "I signed off on those containers personally, Mr. Kellerman. They were sealed and labeled as inert archaeological specimens. My certification logs show that clearly."
His smile doesn't waver. "Dr. Yuen, your recent medical trauma is concerning. Head injuries, blood loss, oxygen deprivation - all can affect recall. And your... personal relationship with the deceased Captain might cloud your judgment about his actions."
Personal relationship? You and Chen exchange glances. Was there something between Yuen and Morrison?

You look at Yuen, catching her eye. She picks up smoothly.
"Mr. Kellerman, I worked with Captain Morrison for two years," she says, her voice steady. "He was meticulous about procedures. When those containers arrived, every seal was intact. Every documentation code checked out. The manifests said archaeological specimens from site LV-426. Inert. Safe."
Kellerman's smile tightens slightly. "Documentation can be misread, Dr. Yuen."
"Not by Morrison," Chen jumps in, finding her confidence. "I watched him spend three hours once verifying a single shipping code because one digit looked off. If those containers had shown any sign of biological hazard, he would have spaced them immediately."
You continue your simplified account - the creatures, the infection, the crew's desperate fight.

Kellerman's composure cracks, just slightly. His jaw tightens, and he leans back in his chair - the first defensive gesture he's made.
"Our offer," he says, voice harder now, "is generous considering the circumstances. Considering that U.E.S. will likely fold after paying out damages. Considering that you three will be unemployable once word spreads that you were on the contamination ship."
There it is - the stick after the carrot.
"But perhaps," he continues, "we should discuss individual arrangements. Dr. Yuen, as the cargo specialist who signed off on these containers, you bear particular responsibility. Weyland could pursue criminal negligence charges. Or... we could ensure your medical license transfers smoothly to a core world hospital. Your choice."
He's trying to split you up, just as Holbrook predicted.
"Mr. Stargazer, your memory anomaly makes you an unreliable witness. No court would take your testimony seriously. But 250,000

s could buy excellent neurological treatment."
"And Ms. Chen, junior engineers are easily replaced. But with Weyland's recommendation, you could have your own ship to run."
Yuen's knuckles are white as she grips her wheelchair arms. Chen's face is flushed with anger.
"We should discuss this together," you say carefully. "As a crew."
Kellerman's smile turns predatory. "Oh, but Mr. Stargazer, there is no crew anymore. The Wanderer is destroyed. Morrison is dead. You're just three individuals with potentially conflicting interests."
He stands. "I'll give you 24 hours to consider. Each of you. Separately. My direct line will be open for individual negotiations."
He reaches to cut the connection, then pauses. "Oh, one more thing. Weyland's security division has been alerted to potential theft of proprietary biological data. If any such data were to surface, we would pursue it vigorously. Such theft carries a twenty-year sentence."
The screen goes dark.
Chen explodes. "That slimy, threatening—"

Chen lets out a whoop of triumph. "He slipped! The bastard actually slipped!"
"Don't celebrate yet," Holbrook warns. "He'll claim it was a figure of speech, that he meant the archaeological specimens had proprietary value. But it's a crack in their story. Combined with other evidence..."
She pauses. "Mr. Stargazer, are you recording this conversation as well?"
Your fingers are still dancing across the terminal interface, looking for the system's recording cache.

Your fingers fly across the terminal with the fluid precision that made you the Wanderer's best tech specialist. The diplomatic suite's system isn't just advanced - it's deliberately transparent, designed for exactly this kind of situation.
"Got it!" You pull up the system architecture. "Director, this entire suite is wired for diplomatic protection protocols. Everything coming in or out is triple-cached - local storage, security backup, and..." your mandibles click in satisfaction, "legal archive with tamper-proof timestamps."
"Correct," Holbrook confirms. "The diplomatic wing was designed for exactly these situations. Corporate intimidation of witnesses is, sadly, not uncommon."
But you're not done. Your successful probing reveals something else - a hidden partition in the system showing ALL of Kellerman's recent communication attempts.
"Director, he's been trying to contact us individually for the past two hours," you report, scanning the logs. "Sixteen attempts to reach Dr. Yuen's private terminal, twelve to Chen's, eight to mine. All blocked by your security protocols."
"The man's desperate," Chen observes. "He knows he messed up."
Yuen is studying the recording playback on her screen. "There - right there. When he said 'proprietary biological data,' his left eye twitched. It's a tell. He knew he'd made an error the moment he said it."
Your exploration also reveals something interesting: "Director, your security chief Torres has been routing all of Kellerman's attempted communications through a forensic analyzer. She's building a pattern profile - trying to predict his next move."
"Torres is thorough," Holbrook says with satisfaction. "Now, we have 24 hours before his deadline. He'll try to circumvent our protections, maybe even attempt physical contact. Be ready."
The terminal beeps. Another incoming message - this time from Jonathan Park, U.E.S.
"Official debrief in one hour," his message reads. "Director Ho

"Director," you say, pulling up Park's nervous profile from yesterday, "what do you recommend we tell Park? He's our employer's rep, but he's clearly out of his depth."
Holbrook considers. "Jonathan Park is a middle manager who thought he'd gotten a cushy station posting. He's not equipped for this level of corporate warfare. That said, he's not your enemy - he's just terrified of losing U.E.S. even more money."
"So we tell him...?" Chen prompts.
"The truth, but carefully. He needs to file his report to U.E.S. headquarters. If he panics and writes something that contradicts your statements, Kellerman will use it. Keep it simple: you were hired for a salvage run, Morrison was given falsified cargo manifests, Weyland is trying to blame you for their deception."
Torres's voice cuts in over the comm. "Director, Kellerman just tried to physically enter Section A. My team turned him away, but he's claiming legal right to access his company's 'stolen property.'"
"He means Martinez's data log," Yuen says quietly.
Holbrook's tone sharpens. "He has no such rights. Torres, maintain security. Now, survivors - Park is essentially harmless but he's also transparent. Assume anything you tell him will be public knowledge within hours. He can't help it; when he's nervous, he talks."
The terminal shows another blocked call from Kellerman, then a text message that somehow got through: "Individual offers expire in 23 hours. Consider your futures carefully."
"One more thing," Holbrook adds. "Park's already received three separate 'briefings' from Kellerman's legal team. They're trying to confuse him with technical details. Keep your story clear and consistent. Don't let him get tangled in Weyland's web."
Chen checks the time. "Forty-five minutes until Park arrives."
What does Dax do to prepare? Would you like to coordinate your story with Chen and Yuen, review any evidence, or make any other preparations before the U.E.S. debrief?

dax thanks the director and assures her they're on it before ending the call naturally.
he turns to chen and yuen and says something to the effect of, obviously we're not taking weyland's deal, right? mostly in jest, partly an earnest ask just in case either of the other two are


### Entry 185 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
"Thanks, Director. We're on it," you say, closing the connection with a polite nod.
You turn to Chen and Yuen, letting out a dry laugh - a clicking sound from your throat that humans find unsettling but your crewmates have learned means amusement. "So, obviously we're not taking Kellerman's deal... right?"
The question hangs half-joking, but you watch their faces carefully. After everything, you need to know they're solid.
Chen snorts. "Oh sure, let me just sell my soul for a ship to run. Because working for the company that murdered our crew sounds like a real career boost." She shakes her head. "Besides, they'd probably space me the first time I asked too many questions."
Yuen is quieter, staring at her hands. For a moment, you worry she might actually be considering it. Then she looks up. "They killed Morrison. They killed everybody. They tried to kill us." Her voice is steady, cold. "I signed those containers because I was deceived. But if I take their money now, knowing what they are? Then I really am complicit."
She shifts in her wheelchair. "Besides, twenty years for theft of biological data? They're threatening us with prison while offering bribes. That tells me they're scared of what we know."
"Martinez's data log," Chen says, patting her pocket where it's hidden. "They don't know we have it, but they're worried we might."
You check the time. Thirty minutes before Park arrives.
"Alright, so we're united. We stick to the simple truth with Park - we were crew doing our jobs, Morrison was a hero, Weyland deceived everyone. Nothing about memory locks or prior knowledge."
Chen grins. "And we let Kellerman stew in his own desperation for 23 more hours."
Roll a Perception check (d20 + 1) to notice something about your surroundings before the debrief.
What do you roll?

### Entry 187 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Perception check: 4 (Failed)
You're so focused on the data log problem that you don't notice the subtle hum of surveillance equipment activating in the corner of the room, or the way the air vent grating shifts slightly.
"Chen, we need to backup Martinez's data," you say urgently. "If Weyland's this desperate—"
"Already thinking the same thing," Chen interrupts, pulling out the small device. "But we need to maintain chain of custody for it to be valid evidence. Can't just copy it wildly."
You move to the terminal, your tech expertise kicking in. "The diplomatic suite has forensic data protocols. We can create a legally admissible backup with tamper-proof encryption and timestamp verification."
Roll a Technology check (d20 + 3) to create a secure, legally valid backup of Martinez's data log.
Chen keeps watch by the door while Yuen monitors the communications terminal for any more attempts from Kellerman.
"Twenty minutes until Park," Yuen warns. "And Kellerman just tried calling again. Text message this time: 'Dr. Yuen, your medical future depends on the next 23 hours. Think carefully.'"
"Focusing on her because she seems most vulnerable," Chen observes. "Injured, guilty about the cargo. He's a predator."
The data log's interface glows as you connect it to the terminal. The file sizes are larger than expected - Martinez documented everything. Video logs, shipping manifests, communication records...
"This is it," you mutter, working to establish the secure backup. "This is what terrifies them."
What do you roll for the Technology check?


### Entry 188 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Technology check: 11 (rolled


### Entry 189 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
Technology check: 11 (Partial Success)
You manage to create a backup, but the process is messier than you'd like. The diplomatic suite's forensic protocols are more complex than expected - designed for legal documents, not military-grade encrypted logs.
"Got it... mostly," you mutter as the progress bar completes. "The backup is secure and timestamped, but I had to compress some of the video files. The manifests and communication records are perfect, but some of Martinez's personal video logs lost resolution."
"Better than nothing," Chen says, but she's frowning. "Wait, did you—"
Suddenly, the terminal flashes a warning: "EXTERNAL ACCESS ATTEMPT DETECTED - BLOCKED"
Your hasty backup triggered a security flag. Someone just tried to piggyback on your connection to access the system.
"Kellerman's team," Yuen says grimly. "They're monitoring for any data transfers."
You quickly check - the backup is secure in the diplomatic suite's legal archive, but now Weyland knows you're doing something with data. They don't know what, but they know you're active.
A knock at the door interrupts. "Mr. Park here for the debrief," comes a nervous voice.
Chen quickly pockets the original data log while you close all the backup protocols.
Park enters, looking even more frazzled than yesterday. His suit is wrinkled, there's coffee stains on his sleeve, and his hands shake slightly as he sets up his recording device.
"I, uh, I need to take your official statements for U.E.S. records," he stammers. "Mr. Kellerman has been... very insistent that I get your full account. He's called me seventeen times this morning."
The poor man looks like he hasn't slept.
"He offered me a promotion," Park says suddenly, then looks horrified at himself. "I mean, he suggested U.E.S. might benefit from... I shouldn't have said that."
Yuen gives you a meaningful look. Kellerman's trying to buy everyone.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 190 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax starts to try to calm park, and looks to yuen to carry it on.
(btw you can roll for chen and yuen in situations like this)
he then starts into the same spiel again, increasingly more rehearsed. this time, honest but only critical information. less of the gore and emotion, more of the cold


### Entry 191 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
"Mr. Park, please, sit down. Take a breath," you say gently, gesturing to a chair with one of your lower arms. "You look exhausted."
Yuen smoothly takes over, her medical training showing. "When did you last eat something? Chen, get him some water from the dispenser."
Rolling Persuasion for Yuen (d20+2): 15 (Success!)
Park visibly relaxes as Yuen's calm bedside manner takes effect. "I... thank you. Kellerman's been relentless. He even showed up at my quarters at 0500."
"That's harassment," Chen says flatly, handing him water. "You could file a complaint."
"Against Weyland?" Park laughs bitterly, then takes a shaky sip.
You begin your account, stripped of emotion this time. Just facts. "The Wanderer was contracted for salvage operation. Captain Morrison received cargo containers with manifests listing inert archaeological specimens from LV-426. Dr. Yuen verified the seals and documentation as per protocol. During transit, biological contamination occurred. The organisms were aggressive and infected multiple crew members."
You continue methodically through the timeline. Chen and Yuen occasionally add technical details - Chen about the engineering failures, Yuen about the medical impossibilities of containing the infection.
Park types frantically, trying to keep up. "And the captain?"
"Maintained quarantine protocols until the end," you state simply. "He ensured no contamination reached the escape pods. Saved the station from infection."
Park pauses his typing. "Kellerman says you stole proprietary data."
Rolling Insight for Chen (d20+1): 16 (Success!)
Chen catches your eye - Park isn't accusing, he's fishing. He wants you to give him something to push back against Kellerman with.
"We escaped with our lives and the clothes on our backs," Chen says carefully. "Any logs or records would be standard ship data, property of U.E.S., not Weyland."
Park nods quickly, typing. "Of course. Standard operational records. Property of the ship's owner." He looks up mean


### Entry 192 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax looks at the other two and let's park know that's the whole story. it's clear they'll have much better luck with the director than with UES going forward. dax almost begins resigning in his mind as he reaches this realization; grateful though he is with park's apparent


### Entry 193 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You exchange glances with Chen and Yuen. "That's the whole story, Mr. Park. Everything relevant to U.E.S.'s needs."
Park nods, still typing, but his shoulders slump slightly. You can see it in his eyes - he knows U.E.S. can't protect you from Weyland. A small shipping company versus a interstellar corporation? The math is brutal.
"I'll file this immediately," Park says quietly. "For what it's worth, I believe you. Morrison was a good captain. But..." he trails off, closing his tablet. "U.E.S. has maybe six months of operating capital left. The insurance claim from losing the Wanderer will bankrupt us. I'll probably be job hunting myself soon."
He stands to leave, then pauses at the door. "Director Holbrook has real authority here. Independent stations have their own laws." He meets your eyes. "I'm just saying, if I were in your position, I'd be thinking about who can actually protect me."
After Park leaves, Chen breaks the silence. "He's basically telling us to jump ship."
"Can you blame him?" Yuen asks. "U.E.S. is done. They can't fight Weyland."
You feel your lower arms curl involuntarily - a Vexian stress response. Your entire career, such as it was, is evaporating. But then again, you're alive. Morrison and the others aren't.
The terminal chimes. Another message from Kellerman: "22 hours remain. Individual meetings can be arranged through secure channels."
Then, unexpectedly, a second message appears - from Director Holbrook: "Mr. Park just filed his report. I'd like to discuss your future options. All three of you. My office, at your convenience."
Chen looks at the competing messages. "Two very different paths."
"Not really," Yuen says firmly. "One's a trap, the other's a lifeline."
What does Dax do?


### Entry 194 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
i don't think dax values UES particularly as a 'home', not in a corporate sense. he probably doesn't lament the loss of UES as a company or of his job; he knows he's incredible skilled, he could get a job anywhere. but he has more important things on his mind right now.growing frustrated with kellerman's constant messages, dax looks for a way to block notifications from him on their shared terminal. "pest" he says.
they then go to meet the


### Entry 195 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You mutter "Pest" in Vexian - a particularly satisfying curse that sounds like grinding gears - as another notification from Kellerman pops up. Your fingers dance across the terminal, finding the notification settings.
Rolling Technology check (d20+3): 14 (Success!)
You quickly set up a filter that routes all of Kellerman's messages to a separate folder. They'll still be recorded for evidence, but won't interrupt you every thirty seconds.
"There," you say with satisfaction. "He can shout into the void."
Chen grins. "Nice. Now let's go see someone actually worth talking to."
The walk to Holbrook's office takes you through the administrative heart of Titan Station. Unlike the corporate sectors with their logos and polished surfaces, this area feels functional, lived-in. The walls have scuff marks from years of foot traffic. The people you pass nod respectfully but don't stare - they've seen stranger things than a Vexian and his injured crewmates.
Commander Torres meets you at the security checkpoint. "Director's expecting you," she says crisply, then adds in a lower voice, "Kellerman tried to follow you. He's currently enjoying a lengthy security screening."
Holbrook's office overlooks Saturn's rings. The massive gas giant fills half the view, its storms swirling in ancient patterns. The Director stands with her back to you, hands clasped behind her.
"Twelve ships this week have cancelled their docking requests," she says without turning. "Word's already spreading about the contamination incident. Even though we contained it, fear travels faster than truth."
She faces you. "Which brings us to your situation. Park's report makes it clear U.E.S. can't protect you. Kellerman won't stop. And I have a station to protect from both biological contamination and corporate predation."
She gestures to chairs. "So let's discuss realistic options. I can't offer you millions in

s, but I can offer something Kellerman can't - legitimate legal protection and a chance to see justice done."
"What are you proposing?" Yuen asks.
"Formal refugee status under station law. You'd be under my direct protection while we build a case. My legal team has been studying the recordings. Combined with proper evidence, we might actually nail Weyland for deliberate biological warfare."
She pauses. "But I need complete honesty. No more partial truths. If we're doing this, I need to know everything."
Chen shifts uncomfortably. The data log suddenly feels heavy in her pocket.
What does Dax do?


### Entry 197 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax looks to the others for agreement, wanting to make sure this is a decision all three of them make together. they've not chosen a 'leader' among them, they're flying by the seat of their pants. 
dax gauges chen's response, though he's confident from her words earlier that she wants the same thing he does - justice. with that, he suggests handing the datapad over to the director to ensure its security. he also lets her know he... tried to back it up to their room terminal, but that her experts might want to take a second look at


### Entry 198 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You look between Chen and Yuen, catching their eyes. This needs to be unanimous - you've survived by trusting each other, and that can't change now.
Chen meets your gaze steadily, then gives a small nod. Her hand moves to her pocket protectively, but her expression is resolute.
Yuen doesn't hesitate. "We're in this together," she says simply. "All three of us, or none of us."
You turn back to Holbrook. "We accept. And in the interest of complete honesty..." You gesture to Chen, who slowly pulls out Martinez's data log and places it on the Director's desk.
Holbrook's eyebrows rise slightly. "Is this—"
"Security Chief Martinez's personal log," Chen confirms. "He was documenting irregularities before he died. Everything's on there - shipping manifests, communication records, his own investigations."
"I tried to create a backup on our room's terminal," you add, your mandibles clicking slightly in embarrassment. "The forensic protocols were more complex than expected. Your experts mig

dax looks to yuen for approval to share the memory


### Entry 200 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You turn to Yuen, raising an eyebrow in silent question. The memory lock was her work as much as yours - she deserves a say in whether to reveal it.
Yuen hesitates, her fingers drumming nervously on her wheelchair arm. Then she takes a deep breath and nods. "Tell her. All of it."
You face Holbrook. "Three weeks ago, I discovered something about the cargo. Connected some dots about Weyland's involvement. I went to Dr. Yuen with my suspicions."
"And I helped him hide those memories," Yuen continues, her voice steady now. "A neurological lock. Temporary amnesia triggered by specific circumstances. We knew if Weyland was involved, they'd have ways of extracting information. So we made sure there was nothing to extract."
Holbrook leans back slowly. "That's why your medical scan showed anomalies. You deliberately gave yourself brain damage as insurance."
"Reversible," you clarify. "The memories came back during the crisis. But it meant during any initial interrogation, I genuinely could

ated memory suppression suggests you knew the cargo was dangerous enough to warrant extreme measures." She looks at each of you. "You three have been playing a longer game than anyone realized."
"We were trying to survive," you say simply. "And get evidence."
"Well, you succeeded. Torres, implement Protocol Seven. Our three guests are now material witnesses under station protection. Full security detail, restricted access, and..." she smiles slightly, "complete communications blackout from Weyland representatives."
The relief in the room is palpable.
"Kellerman's going to lose his mind," Chen says with satisfaction.
"Let him," Holbrook replies. "We have 21 hours before his deadline. Let's see how desperate he gets when he realizes his prey has found sanctuary."
What does Dax do?


### Entry 202 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax feels a weight off his shoulders, having let the director know everything. he's confident they've made the right choice in trusting her. 
he suggests the three head back to their room for a chat, with no prying


### Entry 203 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
The weight that's been crushing your chest for days finally lifts. Your secondary arms, which had been held defensively tight against your body, relax for the first time since you woke from cryo.
"Director, thank you," you say simply. "We should head back to our quarters now. Let you and your team work."
Holbrook nods. "Torres will assign you a discrete security detail. They'll be around but not intrusive. Get some rest - real rest. Tomorrow we start building the case properly."
The walk back feels different. The station corridors seem less oppressive, the recycled air easier to breathe. Even Yuen looks lighter despite her injuries.
Once your quarters' door seals behind you, Chen immediately checks for surveillance devices - old habit from the Wanderer. "We're clean," she confirms.
You settle into chairs facing each other, no terminal between you, no official recording. Just three survivors who've been through hell together.
"So," Chen says, breaking the silence. "We actually did it. We're safe. Relatively speaking."
"For now," Yuen adds, but without her earlier pessimism. "Kellerman won't give up easily."
You lean forward. "We need to talk about what happens next. Not the legal case - us. We're not crew anymore. Park was right about that at least. So what are we to each other now?"
It's the question that's been hovering unasked. Are you three going to stick together after this is over, or will you drift apart once the crisis ends?
"I've been thinking about that," Chen says quietly. "We know each other's worst moments now. Saw each other break and keep going anyway. That's not something you just walk away from."
Yuen shifts in her wheelchair. "Morrison would want us to look out for each other. He died to save us - all of us. That means something."
The room falls quiet, each of you lost in thought about what comes after justice, after survival, after the adrenaline fades.
What does Dax say to his companions about their future?


### Entry 204 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax suggests they team up - officially. maybe not on paper just yet, not while weyland is still likely watching things like crew manifests and whatever a 'registered team' might look like legally. but dax says dedicating himself to this cause, with these two, for the sake of their crewmates, would be nothing short of an honor.
dax wants to start a conversation to learn about one another. ic it's to learn more about their histories, their strengths. ooc it's to get a gauge for their stats and skills.

### Entry 205 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
"We should team up - officially," you say, your voice carrying a certainty you haven't felt in days. "Not on paper yet, not while Weyland's watching crew manifests and legal registrations. But dedicating myself to this cause, with you two, for Morrison and the others... it would be an honor."
Chen's eyes brighten. "A team. I like that. Better than drifting apart and always wondering 'what if.'"
"But we need to know each other better," you continue. "Not just as crewmates in crisis, but as people. Our strengths, our backgrounds. If we're doing this, we do it smart."
You lean back. "I'll start. Grew up in the Vexian colony ships - you know how we are about tech and spatial navigation. Four arms help with multitasking. I'm good with systems, patterns, making connections others miss. But I'm terrible at reading people sometimes, and my strength..." you flex one of your thinner upper arms, "let's just say I won't be winning any arm-wrestling contests."
Chen grins. "I noticed. Alright, my turn. Colony kid from Mars, engineering family going back three generations. I can fix anything with moving parts, and I'm quick on my feet - had to be, growing up in the lower sectors. Good in a fight, better at avoiding them. But I'm impulsive, you've probably noticed. Rush in first, think later."
Rolling to determine Chen's stats based on her description:

High DEX and INT, moderate CON and WIS, average STR and CHA

Yuen shifts, considering. "Earth-born, actually. Medical school on Luna. I'm... methodical. Careful. Good under pressure when I have time to think. Obviously medical training, but also biochemistry, some xenobiology." She pauses. "I'm older than both of you. More experienced with corporate politics. But I'm not a fighter, and I overthink things. Freeze when I need to act fast."

2. what obligations, familial or otherwise, they have and where, in case it becomes a blocker later


### Entry 207 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
"We need to talk practical matters," you say, settling into a more serious tone. "If things go bad - and with Weyland, they might - we may need to move fast. Be mobile. We should know what resources we're working with."
Chen nods. "Smart. No surprises later."
"I'll start," you offer. "I've got about 3,000


### Entry 208 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s in savings. Not much, but I lived cheap on the Wanderer. No family in this system - my clutch-siblings are all back in Vexian space, two months' travel at best. No debts, no obligations. I can move tomorrow if needed."
Chen whistles low. "3,000? That's... responsible. I've got maybe 800

"No one's asking you to," Yuen says gently. "Family is family. I've got about 12,000


### Entry 210 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s saved. No immediate family - my parents passed years ago, no siblings. But..." she hesitates, "I've been sending money to a clinic on Europa. They treat miners who can't afford corporate healthcare. It's not an obligation, exactly, but—"
"It's who you are," you finish. "That's not a weakness."
"So between us, about 15,000


### Entry 211 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s plus whatever survivor benefits U.E.S. manages to pay out," Chen calculates. "That's maybe three months operating expenses if we're careful. Six if we're desperate."
"The station's supporting us for now," you point out. "But you're right, we need to think long-term."
Yuen adjusts her position, wincing slightly. "There's something else. My medical license is registered through Earth's regulatory board. If Weyland pushes, they could have it suspended pending investigation. That's my whole livelihood."
"My engineering certs are Mars-based," Chen adds. "Harder to revoke, but Weyland has offices there."
"My technical certifications are through the Vexian Trade Collective," you say. "Weyland has no influence there, but it means nothing in human space without corporate sponsorship."
The weight of your vulnerability sits heavy in the room. Three people with modest savings and careers that could be destroyed with a few legal filings.
"We need this case to work," Chen says quietly. "Not just for justice. For survival."
"Or we need to disappear completely," Yuen suggests. "New identities, outer colonies where Weyland has no reach."
"That costs more than 15,000


### Entry 212 - PLAYER [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
s," you note. "Good fake identities that would fool biometric scans? We're talking 50,000 minimum."
The terminal chimes again. This time it's not Kellerman - it's Director Holbrook.
"Preliminary review of Martinez's data is revealing significant evidence. Legal team wants to meet tomorrow at 0800. Also, Mr. Kellerman has formally requested arbitration. I've denied it, but he's escalating to sector authorities. We may have less time than we thought."
Chen looks at the message. "The clock's ticking faster."
What does Dax want to do with the remaining evening?


### Entry 213 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
dax wants to reassure them that their obligations back home will be accounted for every step of the way. he wants them to consider what belongs to one, belongs to all - the profit and the debt both (not in those words though, i can't find another way to say it lol).

"Listen," you say, leaning forward, your lower arms gesturing for emphasis. "Your obligations - Chen's brother, Yuen's clinic - those are our obligations now. We share everything. The profits when we have them, the debts when they come. Three bodies, one fund."
Chen blinks, surprised. "Dax, that's... you barely know us."
"I know enough. We survived hell together. We're choosing to fight together. That means all in." You click your mandibles thoughtfully. "My people, we have a saying - 'The web holds because all strands share the weight.'"
Yuen's eyes soften. "That's either very noble or very naive."
"Maybe both," you admit. "But it's how teams become family."
Chen runs her hand through her hair. "Alright. Three bodies, one fund. But I'm keeping track of every

"Agreed," Yuen says. "Now, can we please eat? Hospital food was terrible and I'm starving."
You move to the kitchenette, grateful for the normal domesticity of finding food. The diplomatic quarters have a decent selection - actual fresh vegetables, protein that isn't reconstituted, even some Vexian fungi that makes you unexpectedly homesick.
As you prepare dinner together - Chen chopping vegetables with engineering precision, Yuen directing from her chair, you handling multiple tasks with practiced ease - the conversation drifts to lighter things.
"So," Chen asks, stealing a piece of carrot, "how does a Vexian end up on a human crew anyway?"
"Stubbornness," you reply, managing three pans at once. "Told my clutch-mother I wanted to see the galaxy. She said stick to Vexian ships. I signed with U.E.S. the next day."
"Rebel," Chen laughs. "I like it."
Over dinner, you trade stories. Chen's first spacewalk where she forgot to tether and had to be rescued by a very irritated supervisor. Yuen's medical school prank involving anatomically correct jello sculptures. Your first time trying human coffee and being awake for three days straight.
For an hour, you're not survivors or witnesses or targets. You're just three friends sharing a meal.
As you clean up, the terminal shows Kellerman has sent 73 blocked messages.
"New record," Chen observes.
"Let him stew," Yuen yawns. "I need actual sleep. Tomorrow's going to be intense."
You all head to your respective rooms, but leave the connecting doors open - close enough to hear if anyone needs help. It's a small gesture, but it matters.

Around 0300, your subconscious picks up something - a subtle vibration through the station's hull that doesn't match the normal rhythm of Titan's systems. Your Vexian ancestry makes you sensitive to structural harmonics, and this is... wrong.
Your eyes snap open. Through the open connecting doors, you can hear Chen's steady breathing and Yuen's occasional shift in her bed. But there's something else - a faint scratching sound from the ventilation system.
You silently rise, all four arms moving in practiced quiet as you approach the vent. The scratching stops immediately. Then, barely visible through the grating, you catch a glimpse of something retreating - a small drone, no bigger than your fist.
Surveillance drone. Not station standard - too sleek, too quiet.
You quickly wake the others with gentle touches. Chen comes alert instantly, hand reaching for a weapon that isn't there. Yuen takes a moment longer, still groggy from pain meds.
"Drone in the vents," you whisper. "Someone's watching."
Chen curses quietly. "Kellerman?"
"Or someone working for him," Yuen suggests.
You examine the vent more closely. The grating has micro-scratches around the screws - it's been removed and replaced recently. Professional job, but not perfect.
"They've probably been monitoring us since we got here," you realize. "Maybe heard everything."
"The data log," Chen says, alarmed.
"Already with Holbrook's people," Yuen reminds her. "But they know we had it."
The terminal suddenly lights up with an incoming message - not blocked this time. It's from an unknown sender:
"Impressive detection skills, Mr. Stargazer. Most people never notice our surveillance. Consider this a professional courtesy - Kellerman has hired private contractors. Your 18-hour deadline stands, but the parameters have changed. We have recordings of your conspiracy discussion. Accepting Weyland's offer is no longer optional. - Osprey Security Solutions"
Chen reads it over yo

You signal to Chen, pointing at the vent with two arms while miming unscrewing with the others. She nods immediately, understanding.
"Yuen, keep watch on the door," you whisper.
Chen grabs a multi-tool from her personal kit - one of the few things she salvaged - while you position yourself to catch whatever's in there. Your four arms give you an advantage for this kind of delicate work.

The screws come out smoothly. You've done this before on the Wanderer, chasing circuit problems through ventilation shafts. As the grate comes free, you spot the drone - it's trying to back away deeper into the vent.
Rolling Dexterity check for Chen (d20+4): 19 (Success!)
Chen's hand shoots into the vent with the speed that comes from years of grabbing tools in zero-g before they float away. "Got it!"
She pulls out a matte black drone, no bigger than a clenched fist. It's still active, a red recording light blinking.
"High-end tech," you observe, examining it with your upper arms while your lower ones hold it steady. "Military grade. This thing costs more than we have in savings combined."
"It's still transmitting," Chen notes, pointing at an indicator light.
"Not for long," you say, finding the main processor with practiced ease. One quick twist and the drone goes dead.
"They know we found it," Yuen says from her position by the door. "That message timing wasn't coincidence."
You crack open the drone's casing. Inside is a memory chip and... something else. A maker's mark. "Osprey Security Solutions. Same group that signed the message."
"Private military contractors doing corporate espionage," Chen says grimly. "This is beyond Kellerman's authority. Someone higher up at Weyland authorized this."
The terminal chimes again. Director Holbrook: "Security alert in your sector. My team is en route. Do not leave your quarters."
Thirty seconds later, Torres and two security officers arrive. She takes one look at the disab

### Entry 221 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-21T00:00:00.000Z]
You quickly gather your few possessions - not much survived the Wanderer. As you pack, you hand the disabled drone to Torres.
"Can your people extract data from this? Find out what it recorded, where it was transmitting?"
Torres examines the drone with professional interest. "Our forensics team can try. Osprey's good, but they're not infallible." She bags it carefully. "This is evidence of corporate espionage on a diplomatic station. That's a federal crime."
As you move through the corridors, Chen carrying both her bag and helping steady Yuen, you notice Torres's security detail is larger than before - six officers in full tactical gear.
"Osprey Security," you say to Torres as you walk. "What are we dealing with?"
"Ex-military contractors. They do the work corporations can't officially sanction. Intimidation, extraction, sometimes worse." She glances back at you. "If Weyland hired them, someone very high up is very worried about what you know."
The secure wing is deep in the station's core - no external walls, no vents large enough for drones, one heavily guarded entrance. Your new quarters are smaller but feel safer - a common room with three attached bedrooms, military-grade security systems visible on every surface.
"My forensics team will work on the drone," Torres says. "We might be able to trace the transmission endpoint, see where the data was going. Osprey's tough, but they sometimes get sloppy with their encryption when they think they won't get caught."
Holbrook appears on the secure terminal. "The drone changes things. I'm advancing our timeline. Legal team will meet you at 0600 instead of 0800. We need to file charges before Osprey tries something more direct."
"More direct?" Chen asks.
"Extraction. Kidnapping. Making you disappear." Holbrook's expression is grim. "They've done it before. Never proved, but suspected in twelve cases of missing witnesses."

The name Osprey triggers a cascade of memories - spacer rumors, hushed conversations in stations bars, and one very specific incident.
"Osprey Security Solutions," you say slowly. "They were behind the Ceres Mining whistleblower disappearance three years ago. The pattern's identical - surveillance first, escalating pressure, then the witness vanished during a 'transport malfunction.' They also worked the Proxima bioweapons coverup."
Your lower arms gesture as you recall more details. "They have a signature method - they prefer to make problems disappear legally first.

The Vexian's expression grows serious, his large eyes reflecting the amber glow from the viewport. "Torres is good people, and now she knows what she's up against. Osprey operatives are dangerous, but they're not invincible. The lockdown, the surveillance upgrades, the restricted access - it all helps level the playing field."

**Failed Rest - Restless Night**

Despite the exhaustion weighing on all of you, sleep proves elusive. Every creak of the station's hull, every distant footstep in the corridors beyond your secure wing, every subtle shift in the air recycling systems has you all on edge.

Dax finds himself staring at the ceiling, his mind racing through contingencies and worst-case scenarios. The memory of that surveillance drone's cold electronic eye keeps flashing behind his eyelids. His four arms keep shifting restlessly, unable to find a comfortable position.

Chen tosses and turns in her alcove, the engineer's mind unable to stop analyzing the technical aspects of their situation - how many access points could an Osprey operative exploit? What about maintenance shafts? Emergency systems?

Dr. Yuen manages brief patches of light sleep, but keeps jerking awake with fragments of nightmares about the Wanderer expedition, mixing memories of the infected crew with fears about what tomorrow might bring.

The hours crawl by. 0400. 0430. 0500.

At 0530, soft amber lighting gradually brightens in the quarters - station's automatic wake cycle beginning. You're all already awake, feeling gritty-eyed and on edge rather than rested.

**Status Effect**: All party members are *Fatigued* - disadvantage on the next ability check or saving throw made before getting proper rest.

Your comm unit chimes softly. A message from Director Holbrook: "Legal meeting moved up to 0545. Torres has new intel from the drone analysis. Meet in Conference Room Alpha-7. Security escort en route."

Twenty-nine minutes until what could be the most important meeting of your lives.

What do you do with the remaining time?

Dax moves through his morning routine with mechanical precision, though his usual fluid coordination is dulled by fatigue. All four arms work in practiced sequence - two handling his grooming kit while the other two prep his portable brewing unit from his pack.

"How'd you two sleep?" he asks, voice rougher than usual as he measures out the bitter, dark granules of *keth'var* - a Vexian stimulant that smells like burnt almonds mixed with ozone. The small heating element hums to life, filling the quarters with the sharp, medicinal aroma.

Chen sits up in her alcove, running hands through disheveled hair. "Like garbage," she admits bluntly. "Kept thinking about maintenance access points, emergency overrides... every way someone could get to us despite the security." She stretches, wincing. "My brain wouldn't shut off."

Dr. Yuen emerges from her bunk looking pale and drawn. "Nightmares," she says simply, then adds with dark humor, "Though given our current situation, I'm not sure they qualify as nightmares anymore - more like... previews."

The *keth'var* finishes brewing with a soft chime. Dax pours the steaming, almost-black liquid into a small cup, the stimulant's effects already sharpening his focus just from the smell. "Want some?" he offers. "Fair warning - it's an acquired taste, and it'll make human coffee seem like fruit juice."

Through the viewport, you can see the first hints of Saturn's rings catching distant sunlight as the station continues its rotation. Fourteen minutes until the security escort arrives.

"How'd you two sleep?" he asks, voice rougher than usual as he measures out the mild, earthy granules of *keth'var* - a Vexian stimulant that's barely stronger than herbal tea. The small heating element hums to life, filling the quarters with a gentle, floral aroma.

Chen sits up in her alcove, running hands through disheveled hair. "Like garbage," she admits bluntly. "Kept thinking about maintenance access points, emergency overrides... every way someone could get to us despite the security." She stretches, wincing. "My brain wouldn't shut off."

The *keth'var* finishes brewing with a soft chime. Dax sips the mild stimulant - barely enough to take the edge off his fatigue. He still remembers that disastrous encounter with human coffee three months ago that kept him wired for 72 hours straight.

Setting down his cup, Dax's expression grows serious. "Before we face whatever Torres found, we need to coordinate. I'm confident Holbrook and her team are genuinely on our side - Protocol Seven doesn't get invoked lightly. Our case against Weyland keeps getting stronger with each piece of evidence."

He pauses, all four hands gesturing as he thinks aloud. "But Osprey... that's the wild card. They're not bound by corporate politics or legal procedures. They solve problems permanently."

Dax's mind races through the technical options, quickly abandoning the sabotage attempt. "No point trying to fry it now - we're out of time and it'll just confirm their suspicions."

His four arms gesture rapidly as he shifts to a new strategy. "We need to go nuclear on this. Complete communications blackout for Conference Room 7-Alpha. Not just a lockdown - a total dead room. Faraday cage protocol."

He turns to Commander Torres with urgent intensity. "Can we cut all electronic pathways to that room? Power, data, comms - everything? Make it electronically invisible to the station network until we manually enter for the meeting?"

Torres nods grimly. "Emergency isolation protocol. We can do it, but it's a two-person operation requiring simultaneous authorization codes."

Dax's large eyes scan the room, looking for technical assistance. "Chen, I need your engineering expertise on this. The isolation system requires coordinated shutdown of multiple power grids and communication arrays. Your Mars colony training with emergency systems - this is exactly that kind of critical infrastructure work."

Chen straightens, understanding the gravity. "What do we need to do?"

"Simultaneous isolation commands," Dax explains quickly. "I'll handle the data and communications cutoff, you manage the power grid isolation. We create a complete electronic dead zone."

The emergency isolation protocol executes with flawless precision. Dax and Chen work in perfect synchronization, their combined expertise creating a seamless technical ballet across multiple control interfaces.

"Initiating data pathway isolation," Dax announces, his four arms dancing across communication array controls. "All network connections to Conference Room 7-Alpha are being severed... now."

Chen's fingers fly over the power grid controls with the practiced efficiency of her Mars colony emergency training. "Power grid isolation in progress. Switching to emergency lighting only... cutting primary electrical feeds... done."

Commander Torres coordinates from her command station, watching status indicators shift from green to amber to red as the room disappears from all station systems. "Physical security locks engaging... atmospheric systems switching to independent backup... isolation complete."

On the main display, Conference Room 7-Alpha simply vanishes from the station's electronic infrastructure. Where once there were dozens of status indicators, sensor feeds, and communication pathways, there's now just empty space in the system architecture.

"Perfect," Torres says with genuine admiration. "That room is now completely electronically dead. No signals in, no signals out. The surveillance device inside is effectively useless - it can record whatever it wants, but it can't transmit anything."

Dr. Yuen looks impressed. "So when we enter for the meeting..."

"We'll manually unlock the room, restore minimal power for lighting and life support, but keep all communications isolated," Dax explains. "The Osprey operative will be flying blind."

Director Holbrook nods approvingly. "Excellent work. Now we have a secure meeting space and our enemy doesn't know how we neutralized their surveillance."

Dax's mood lifts considerably as the technical success sinks in. "And we've got a new trinket to inspect," he remarks with genuine enthusiasm, his large Vexian eyes practically gleaming at the prospect of dissecting the surveillance drone they'd captured earlier. "I'm eager to pull apart this new piece of enemy tech we've managed to intercept."

His four arms gesture expressively as his confidence returns. The successful isolation protocol has reminded him that while he might not be built for direct confrontation, his technical expertise is invaluable to the team.

"You know what?" Dax says, stretching and looking around at the group. "I'm feeling good about the meeting prospects. We should grab a bite to eat before Legal Advocate Chen arrives. Build up our energy for what's ahead."

He turns to Director Holbrook and Commander Torres with an unexpectedly warm expression. "Director, Commander - would you join us? I know you've both got duties, but you've done so much for us. The least we can do is share a meal."

Director Holbrook looks surprised by the invitation, while Torres raises an eyebrow with what might be amusement.

"Besides," Dax adds with a slight grin, "Chen and Dr. Yuen here have been putting up with my technical rambling for days. You two might actually appreciate hearing about proper station operations for a change."

His upper arms work on prep while his lower arms handle multiple cooking surfaces simultaneously. "Director, Commander - any preferences? I've gotten pretty good at working with station rations, though I can't promise it'll match whatever the executive dining facilities serve."

Director Holbrook watches with fascination. "I have to admit, I've never seen anyone cook with four arms before. It's remarkably efficient."

"Mars colony cooking was all about speed and efficiency," Chen adds, settling into a chair. "But Dax has turned it into an art form."

As aromatic spices fill the air, Dax continues chatting easily. "You know, Commander Torres, I'm curious about station security protocols. How do you typically handle threats like professional extraction teams? This can't be the first time corporate interests have tried something like this."

Despite Dax's enthusiasm and four-armed efficiency, the meal doesn't quite come together as smoothly as he'd hoped. The spices for Chen's dish turn out stronger than expected, making her cough slightly on the first bite. Dr. Yuen's vegetable medley ends up slightly overcooked, and the protein portions are unevenly heated - some too hot, others barely warm.

"Well," Dax says with a self-deprecating chuckle, noticing the polite but strained expressions around the table, "I guess I was more focused on the conversation than the cooking temperatures."

Director Holbrook takes another careful bite and manages a diplomatic smile. "It's... certainly flavorful."

Commander Torres, more direct in her approach, reaches for extra water after sampling Chen's overly-spiced dish. "Next time maybe ease up on the heat levels?"

Chen, ever loyal, tries to be encouraging. "Hey, the technique is still impressive. Just maybe a little less multitasking while cooking?"

Dr. Yuen nods agreement, pushing around the slightly mushy vegetables. "The effort is what counts, Dax. And honestly, after days of emergency rations, anything home-cooked is appreciated."

The conversation about station security continues, but there's a slightly awkward undertone as everyone works around the culinary missteps. Despite the less-than-perfect meal, the group's camaraderie remains intact, though Dax makes a mental note to focus more on one task at a time in the kitchen.

"So about those security protocols, Commander..." Dax says, trying to steer attention back to more successful territory.

Dax feels his cheeks warming with embarrassment at the culinary disaster, but he pushes the feeling down and refocuses on Commander Torres. His large Vexian eyes show genuine curiosity as he leans forward slightly.

"So, Commander," he says, grateful for the distraction from his cooking mishap, "you mentioned this isn't the first time corporate interests have tried something aggressive on Titan Station. What's the most challenging situation you've had to handle?"

Torres sets down her water glass, seeming relieved to move past the overly-spiced food. "Corporate espionage is fairly common - data theft, bribery attempts, the occasional 'industrial accident' that's anything but accidental. But professional extraction teams? That's rare."

She pauses thoughtfully. "About two years ago, we had a situation with Hegemony Industries trying to forcibly retrieve a defecting researcher. They sent what they called 'corporate security consultants' - essentially mercenaries in business suits."

"How did you handle it?" Dr. Yuen asks, her medical ethics clearly engaged.

"Protocol Seven, same as now. But they made the mistake of trying to breach our security perimeter directly." Torres's expression grows grim. "Station security isn't just for show. We have defensive capabilities that most corporations underestimate."

Director Holbrook nods. "The key difference here is that Osprey is being more subtle. They're trying to work within station protocols rather than against them."

Dax finds himself genuinely engaged in the tactical discussion, his embarrassment about dinner fading. "Which makes them more dangerous, doesn't it? They're playing by the rules while finding ways to bend them."

### Entry 247 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-22T11:31:15.973Z]
Dax feels a genuine wave of relief wash over him as Torres's words sink in. The knowledge that Titan Station's security isn't just bureaucratic posturing - that they actually have the firepower and authority to back up their protective protocols - eases some of the tension he's been carrying since this whole nightmare began.

"That's... actually reassuring," he admits, his four arms relaxing slightly as he continues listening intently. "I was worried we were hiding behind paperwork and hoping corporate politeness would keep us safe."

Torres notices his reaction and her expression softens slightly. "Station security exists because of situations exactly like yours, Dax. We're not just traffic controllers out here - we're the line between corporate overreach and people's lives."

Director Holbrook adds, "The Titan Accords give us significant autonomy precisely because the outer system needs neutral ground. When corporations start deploying extraction teams, it threatens that neutrality."

"Plus," Torres continues, "Osprey may be professional, but they're operating in our territory now. They know our capabilities, which is why they're being subtle. A direct assault would be suicide."

Chen looks up from her overly-spiced meal. "So they're stuck playing the long game?"

"Exactly. They have to work within our systems, which gives us advantages." Torres's tactical mind is clearly engaged. "Time, terrain, and legal authority are all on our side. They're the ones under pressure to produce results quickly."

Dax nods, feeling more confident about their chances as he absorbs this strategic perspective.

### Entry 249 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-22T11:34:52.712Z]
Dax glances around the room, a sudden urgency creeping into his voice. "Commander, what time is it now? How much longer do we have until Osprey's ominous 48-hour 'anything-to-get-results' period is up?"

Torres checks her chronometer, her expression growing more serious. "Current time is 0347 hours. The Osprey ultimatum was delivered at 1200 hours yesterday, so..." she calculates quickly, "we have approximately 32 hours and 13 minutes remaining."

Director Holbrook sets down his fork, the weight of that timeline settling over the group. "Less than a day and a half before they escalate to whatever 'any means necessary' looks like for a professional extraction company."

"And our legal meeting is in..." Dax continues the math.

"Two hours and thirteen minutes," Dr. Yuen finishes, checking her own timepiece. "0600 hours sharp."

Chen pushes her overly-spiced food around her plate thoughtfully. "So if this legal battle goes well, we could potentially resolve everything before Osprey's deadline hits."

Torres nods grimly. "That's the hope. But if it doesn't..." She doesn't finish the sentence, but the implication hangs heavy in the air.

"Thirty-two hours," Dax repeats quietly, his four arms fidgeting with nervous energy. "After that, they stop playing by any rules at all."

The comfortable dinner conversation has suddenly taken on a much more urgent tone as the reality of their timeline reasserts itself.

Insight roll: 14 (success)

As Dax scans the faces around the table, his naturally poor people-reading skills are sharpened by the gravity of their situation. The subtle body language speaks volumes that the polite dinner conversation hasn't voiced.

Director Holbrook's fork hasn't moved for the past thirty seconds - he's staring at his food while his mind clearly races through contingency plans. There's a tightness around his eyes that suggests he's already considering what happens if the legal meeting fails.

Commander Torres keeps checking her wrist display every few minutes, not just for time but likely monitoring security feeds. Her posture has shifted from relaxed dinner guest to alert security chief. She's mentally cataloging threats and resources.

Dr. Yuen is methodically cutting her overcooked vegetables into precise pieces without eating them - a nervous habit Dax has noticed when she's processing medical ethical dilemmas. She's probably running through worst-case scenarios involving the weaponized organisms.

Chen's the most transparent - she's stopped even pretending to eat the overly-spiced food and is drumming her fingers on the table in the quick, staccato rhythm she uses when calculating engineering problems under pressure.

"Everyone's thinking the same thing I am," Dax realizes aloud. "What if the legal meeting doesn't work? What if thirty-two hours isn't enough time?"

The admission breaks the polite facade, and suddenly everyone's real concerns are visible on their faces.

Director Holbrook sighs deeply. "Then we find out exactly what Osprey's 'any means necessary' actually means."

Dax takes a deep breath, his four arms settling into a more confident posture as he straightens up. "You know what? We're as ready as we can be. Like the Director says, this is home turf, and I'm glad to be playing for the right team."

He stands up with renewed determination, pushing away the anxiety that had been creeping in. "And speaking of being ready - let me make everyone's morning drink of choice. Nothing like a good beverage to cleanse the palate after my... creative cooking experiment."

Moving back to the kitchen area, Dax's natural enthusiasm returns as he surveys the beverage options. "Let's see - Dr. Yuen, I'm thinking your usual herbal blend? Chen, strong coffee to fuel that engineering brain of yours?"

He pauses at the Director and Commander. "I'm not sure what you both prefer for early morning fuel. Coffee? Tea? Something stronger given the circumstances?"

His upper arms begin working the beverage station while his lower arms clean up the dinner dishes. "And for me, some proper keth'var to keep these Vexian reflexes sharp. Though I promise to keep the human coffee away from me - learned that lesson about cross-species stimulant reactions the hard way."

The familiar ritual of drink preparation seems to lift everyone's spirits slightly, providing a moment of normalcy before the crucial hours ahead.

Cooking/Hospitality roll: 2 (failure)

Dax's confidence in his beverage-making skills proves to be dramatically misplaced. What should have been a simple morale-boosting gesture quickly turns into a comedy of errors that would be amusing if the timing weren't so terrible.

First, he accidentally uses salt instead of sugar in Dr. Yuen's herbal blend, creating a brackish concoction that makes her wince and politely set the cup aside after one sip. Chen's "strong coffee" turns out weak and lukewarm because Dax forgets to actually activate the heating element, leaving her with what amounts to coffee-flavored water.

Director Holbrook's tea becomes an unidentifiable brown sludge when Dax confuses the steeping time and uses three different tea varieties simultaneously. Commander Torres's coffee somehow ends up with floating grounds throughout - apparently the filter wasn't properly seated.

The crowning disaster comes when Dax prepares his own keth'var. In his nervous multitasking, he accidentally grabs the human coffee instead, taking a large gulp before realizing his mistake. His large Vexian eyes immediately dilate as the alien stimulants hit his system like a freight train.

"Oh no," he says, his voice suddenly higher pitched and shaky. "Oh no, oh no, oh no. That was... that was definitely not keth'var."

The room falls silent as everyone stares at their undrinkable beverages and their now-hypercharged Vexian companion, who's beginning to vibrate slightly from the caffeine overload.

Chen breaks the silence: "Maybe we should stick to water for the meeting."

### Entry 257 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-22T11:39:59.465Z]
Dax's four arms are now trembling slightly from the caffeine surge as he backs away from the kitchen area like it's contaminated with radiation. His large Vexian eyes are wide and darting around the room with hyperactive energy.

"I promise - I solemnly swear - to stay away from the kitchen for the rest of the day," he declares, his voice coming out in rapid, jittery bursts. "Commander Torres, I'm officially requesting that you arrest me if I even touch a utensil. Consider it a public safety measure."

Torres can't help but crack a smile despite the beverage disaster. "I'll consider that an official security directive. No kitchen access for Dax Stargazer until further notice."

"Maybe make that a week," Dr. Yuen suggests gently, pushing her salty herbal tea farther away. "Just to be safe."

Chen stands up and moves toward the beverage station. "Let me handle the drinks. Mars colony training included emergency food prep, and I promise that extends to not poisoning everyone with basic beverages."

"Thank you," Dax says gratefully, his hands still shaking as he tries to sit down but finds himself too wired to stay still. "I don't know what it is about kitchens lately. I used to be decent at this stuff."

Director Holbrook chuckles, the tension in the room finally breaking. "Well, at least you're alert for the meeting. Possibly too alert, but alert nonetheless."

Dax paces in small circles, his caffeine-enhanced nervous system making it impossible to sit still. "Is it hot in here? It feels hot. Are we sure the atmospheric systems are working properly?"

### Entry 259 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-22T11:41:07.809Z]
Dr. Yuen watches Dax's hyperactive pacing with the practiced eye of a xenobiologist who's studied interspecies physiology for years. Her medical training kicks in as she observes his dilated pupils, rapid speech patterns, and inability to remain still.

"Medically speaking," she says, setting down her undrinkable tea, "you're experiencing classic caffeine toxicity symptoms for a Vexian physiology. Your species processes human stimulants about four times more intensely than we do. Heart rate elevated, nervous system overstimulated, but not dangerous - just extremely uncomfortable."

She pauses, watching him attempt to sit down only to immediately spring back up. "The good news is it should peak in about twenty minutes, then gradually fade over the next two hours. You'll be mostly functional by meeting time, just... energetic."

Commander Torres raises an eyebrow. "And tactically?"

Dr. Yuen's expression grows more thoughtful. "That's more concerning. Dax's natural reaction time and technical precision are actually enhanced right now, but his judgment and risk assessment are compromised. He's going to want to act on every impulse, solve every problem immediately."

She looks directly at Dax, who's now examining the wall panels with intense fascination. "In a high-stakes legal meeting where careful words matter, having a hyperactive tech specialist might not be ideal. We need to keep him focused and channel that energy productively."

"Maybe we should give him something technical to analyze," Chen suggests. "Like that surveillance drone?"

Dr. Yuen nods approvingly. "Perfect. Keep his hands and mind busy with something safe."

Dax practically lunges for the disabled surveillance drone, his caffeine-enhanced reflexes making the movement almost comically quick. "Yes! Perfect! Something to actually focus on instead of just... vibrating."

His four arms immediately find their rhythm as he begins disassembling the device with hyperactive precision. Upper arms handle the delicate circuit work while lower arms sort components and hold tools. The familiar technical work seems to channel his jittery energy into something productive.

"Oh, this is interesting," he says, his voice still rapid but more focused now. "This isn't standard Osprey hardware - it's been heavily modified. Look at these micro-transmitters, they're using quantum encryption protocols I've only seen in military-grade systems."

Dr. Yuen watches approvingly as his manic energy becomes directed and purposeful. "Much better. His hands are steady when he's working on tech, even with the caffeine overload."

"What else can you tell us about it?" Torres asks, leaning forward with professional interest.

Dax's large eyes are practically glowing as he peers into the drone's circuitry. "The power cell is custom-designed for extended surveillance - probably good for weeks of passive monitoring. And these sensor arrays..." He pauses, manipulating a tiny component. "They're not just visual. Audio, thermal, even chemical analysis capabilities."

His four arms work in perfect synchronization, the technical challenge clearly helping him manage the stimulant overload.

Technology/Hacking roll: 22 (exceptional success)

Dax's caffeine-enhanced focus combined with his technical expertise creates a perfect storm of analytical precision. As his four arms work in hyperspeed synchronization, he begins uncovering layers of sophisticated engineering that even impresses himself.

"Wait, wait, WAIT," he says, his voice rising with excitement as he carefully extracts a hair-thin fiber optic cable. "This isn't just surveillance - this thing was designed for active data extraction. Look at these neural pathway interfaces!"

He holds up a component no larger than a grain of rice. "This is a quantum tunneling data probe. It can literally pull information through encrypted barriers by exploiting quantum entanglement principles. Military black ops level stuff."

Commander Torres leans in closer. "What kind of information?"

"Anything digital it comes into contact with," Dax explains rapidly, his technical knowledge flowing freely. "Station databases, personal devices, secure communications... but here's the really interesting part." He points to a series of microscopic ports. "It's been modified with biological sampling capabilities."

Dr. Yuen's eyes widen. "Biological sampling?"

"DNA analysis, chemical composition, even pheromone detection. This wasn't just watching us - it was building complete biological and digital profiles." His four arms continue working as he speaks. "And look at this manufacturing signature..."

He pauses, studying a tiny etched marking through a magnifying lens. "This isn't Osprey standard issue. The quantum components are from Hegemony Industries' advanced research division. Someone with serious military-industrial connections built this specifically for our situation."

Director Holbrook's expression grows grim. "They're not just trying to extract you - they're gathering intelligence on everyone involved in protecting you."

Dax's four hands pause their work, the drone components spread across the table as he turns his large, caffeine-dilated eyes toward Dr. Yuen. "This is... way beyond standard corporate espionage. Biological profiling, quantum data extraction - what are we even supposed to do with this level of sophistication?"

Dr. Yuen's medical training and xenobiological expertise kick in as she processes the implications. "This changes the entire threat assessment," she says, her voice calm but serious. "They're not just after extraction - they're building comprehensive dossiers. This suggests long-term strategic interest, not just a quick corporate cover-up."

She moves closer to examine the biological sampling components Dax identified. "From a tactical perspective, this means they're studying our weaknesses, our habits, our physiological responses to stress. They're preparing for multiple scenarios."

Commander Torres nods grimly. "Which means we need to counter-intelligence measures. If they're gathering this level of data, we can potentially feed them false information or use their own surveillance against them."

"But carefully," Dr. Yuen cautions. "They'll be watching for exactly that kind of counter-play. The biological sampling suggests they want to understand our decision-making patterns under pressure."

Director Holbrook looks at the sophisticated device with new respect. "This evidence could be crucial for our legal case. It demonstrates that Weyland isn't just pursuing standard corporate recovery - they're engaged in advanced intelligence gathering that violates multiple interstellar treaties."

Chen speaks up from where she's successfully preparing actual drinkable coffee. "So we use their own high-tech toys against them. Turn their surveillance into our evidence."

Dax looks between them, the caffeine still making his thoughts race but now with clearer direction. "So we're not just defending anymore. We're building our own case with their tools."

Dax's caffeine-addled mind, combined with his natural difficulty reading people, completely misses the subtle tension in Dr. Yuen's posture. He sees only her professional assessment and takes her words at face value.

"That makes sense," Dax says, his four arms gesturing enthusiastically. "Counter-intelligence, turning their tools against them - we can work with this!"

He completely misses the way Dr. Yuen's eyes keep returning to the biological sampling components with a medical professional's concern. He doesn't notice how she subtly shifts her weight away from the drone, or the slight tightening around her mouth when biological profiling is mentioned.

"Okay, so we've got about two hours until the legal meeting," Dax continues, his energy still surging. "We should document everything about this drone - the quantum components, the biological sampling tech, the Hegemony Industries markings. This could be our smoking gun!"

Dr. Yuen gives a tight smile and nods, but her mind is clearly elsewhere. "Yes, documentation is important. Commander Torres, perhaps we should have security specialists examine the biological components more thoroughly?"

Torres picks up on her concern immediately. "I'll have our forensics team analyze the DNA collection mechanisms. We need to understand exactly what they were trying to gather."

Dax, completely oblivious to the subtext, beams with excitement. "Perfect! Meanwhile, I'll see if I can trace the quantum encryption back to its source. Maybe we can find out who in Hegemony Industries is working with Weyland!"

He turns back to the drone components, his four hands already moving with renewed purpose, completely missing the worried glance exchanged between Dr. Yuen and Commander Torres.

### Entry 269 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-22T16:20:00.752Z]
As the intense effects of the human coffee begin to wane, Dax finds himself sinking deeper into the intricate work with the drone. His movements, though still swift, become less jittery and more deliberate. The world around him narrows to the components spread out before him, each piece a puzzle waiting to be solved or exploited.

The buzz of conversation from his companions fades into the background, their words blending with the soft hum of the station's life support systems. Dax's focus is absolute, his four hands moving with a precision that belies the earlier chaos induced by the stimulant.

He starts tracing the quantum encryption pathways with a fine tool, his mind clearing enough to follow the complex patterns etched into the circuitry. "There's a logic to this design," he mutters to himself, "a signature almost. Someone wanted this drone not just to spy but to be undetectable while doing so."

The clarity brought on by his diminishing caffeine high allows Dax to notice something he missed in his earlier frenzied state. "This circuitry... it's not just advanced; it's ahead of its time. Whoever built this had access to technology that's not supposed to be out for another year."

As the last traces of caffeine-induced hyperactivity dissipate, Dax's natural technical acumen takes over fully. He's now in a state of deep flow, each discovery leading seamlessly to the next. The room, his teammates, even the looming threat of Osprey and Weyland - all of it fades away until there's nothing but him and the machine.

[OOC: Yes, this absolutely rings a bell and makes perfect sense with the story flow! I can see how that conversation would have naturally developed - the trio needing a fourth crew member for "brawn to balance their brains," Holbrook's recommendation of someone heroic and morally-sound, Dax's prudent request for Torres to do a deep background check, and the larger 6-month research contract opportunity that depends on resolving the immediate Osprey threat first.

Let me create a natural moment where this discussion can resurface - perhaps Torres could mention an update on the background check status while Dax is working on the drone, or Holbrook could bring up the timeline for the potential crew meeting in relation to the legal proceedings. This would let us re-establish these important plot threads organically.

Should I have Torres mention that the background check is nearly complete and they could arrange the face-to-face meeting soon? Or would you prefer Holbrook to bring up the research contract timeline in context of resolving the current crisis?]

### Entry 277 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-23T13:46:49.392Z]
Dax remains hunched over the drone components, his four hands moving with methodical precision as the caffeine crash leaves him in a focused, almost meditative state. The conversation around him becomes a comfortable background hum as he works.

"We should discuss our fourth member while we wait," Director Holbrook says, settling back in her chair. "The deep background check is nearly complete."

Commander Torres nods, pulling up a file on her tablet. "Zara Okafor. Former Colonial Marine, discharged honorably after eight years. Explosives specialist, close quarters combat expert. Clean record, no corporate entanglements."

"Why is she available?" Chen asks, leaning forward with interest.

"Medical discharge," Torres explains. "Lost her left arm in a mining accident on Kepler-442b. Got a high-grade prosthetic, but the Marines have strict policies about augmentations in active duty roles."

Dr. Yuen glances over at Dax, who's still absorbed in his work but clearly listening - his antenna-like sensory organs are subtly oriented toward the conversation. "What's her psychological profile like? After what we've been through..."

"Stable. Adaptable. She's been doing freelance security work for the past two years. No corporate loyalties, which is exactly what we need." Holbrook pauses. "The question is whether she'll mesh with your existing dynamic."

Dax's hands slow their work slightly, processing both the conversation and the drone's encrypted data streams simultaneously.

dax finishes up with the drone, confident he's explored it to its fullest. he logs his findings for torres and returns to the group.
he expresses his gratitude for the background check on okafor and suggests the trio meet her face to face once things calm down.

with the immediate caffeine high wearing down, dax refocuses on the task at hand. they've got a disabled spy datapad in the conference room they were supposed to meet in. they've locked it down, disconnected it from station-wide comms, but they still need to get to it.
dax suggests they make their way to the conference room early to retrieve the datapad and plan their strategy for the legal meet.

### Entry 279 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-23T13:50:09.976Z]
Dax carefully sets down the drone components, his movements now more controlled as the caffeine high finally begins to ebb. He quickly compiles his findings into a detailed technical report on Torres's datapad - signal frequencies, encryption protocols, hardware specifications, and the damning evidence of Weyland Biosystems' surveillance network.

"Commander Torres," he says, handing over the device, "full analysis is logged there. This thing was state-of-the-art corporate espionage gear."

He turns to Chen and Dr. Yuen, his four arms gesturing with renewed focus. "I want to thank you all for running the background check on Okafor. Once this legal mess settles down, I think we should meet her face to face. If she's clean, we could use someone with her skillset."

Dr. Yuen nods approvingly. "Agreed. We'll need all the help we can get moving forward."

"Speaking of moving forward," Dax continues, his natural planning instincts kicking in as the stimulant wears off, "we've got that disabled spy datapad sitting in the conference room. It's locked down and isolated from station comms, but we still need to physically retrieve it and see what intelligence we can extract."

Chen checks the time display. "We're supposed to meet the lawyers in there in about an hour anyway."

"Exactly," Dax says. "I suggest we head over early. Get the datapad, sweep the room for any other surveillance, and use the time to plan our strategy for the legal meeting. Better to control the environment than walk into unknown territory."

Torres considers this. "Makes sense. My people can escort you there now and secure the perimeter while you work."

**Persuasion Check: 3 (Critical Failure)**

Torres stops mid-stride and turns to face you, her expression shifting from professional courtesy to stern authority. "Absolutely not, Stargazer." Her voice carries the unmistakable tone of a security commander who's dealt with too many eager civilians trying to bend protocol.

"I don't care if you're bouncing off the walls from that coffee disaster," she continues, gesturing toward the sealed conference room door. "That room is being swept and secured right now. Standard pre-meeting protocol for any session involving corporate representatives, especially when there are active security concerns."

Chen winces slightly at Torres's sharp tone, while Dr. Yuen raises an eyebrow at your obvious restlessness.

"The meeting starts at 0600 hours - not a minute before," Torres states firmly. "Until then, you wait with everyone else. The last thing we need is to give Weyland's people any excuse to claim we're conducting secret preliminary discussions or tampering with the meeting space."

She checks her chronometer. "That's still fifteen minutes. Use the time to get your caffeine levels under control and maybe practice not asking for special treatment when corporate lawyers are involved."

The security checkpoint ahead shows two guards flanking the conference room entrance, their presence making it clear that Torres's refusal isn't just policy - it's actively enforced.

Your four arms fidget restlessly as the minutes tick by, the combination of lingering caffeine and mounting tension making the wait feel interminable.

dax relents. he trusts the director, torres and their team to do the job well. he's sure they'll recover osprey's spy datapad and get to the bottom of why and how it got in there.

he turns to the director and asks her thoughts on how they should approach this legal meeting with weyland's shrewd team.

### Entry 283 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-23T14:31:36.954Z]
Dax nods, his four arms settling into a more relaxed posture as he accepts the security team's expertise. "You're right - this is what you do best. I trust you and your team to handle the technical side." His large compound eyes shift focus as the immediate crisis management gives way to the looming legal confrontation.

He turns toward Director Holbrook, who's been quietly observing the tactical discussion while reviewing data on her tablet. "Director, we've got maybe fifteen minutes before we face Weyland Biosystems' legal team. What's your read on how we should approach this?"

Holbrook sets down her tablet and leans forward, her expression shifting into the sharp focus of someone who's navigated corporate legal warfare before. "Weyland's sending their A-team - I recognize the lead counsel's name from some high-profile cases. They'll come in aggressive, trying to establish that you three are either corporate saboteurs or incompetent spacers who destroyed their 'research vessel.'"

She glances at each of you in turn. "Our advantage is that we're on Titan Station - U.E.S. jurisdiction, not corporate space. But they'll try to frame this as a salvage dispute or even piracy. The key is staying focused on the facts: you responded to a distress beacon, found clear evidence of illegal bioweapons research, and acted to prevent a potential outbreak."

Torres adds grimly, "They'll definitely try to discredit your testimony. Expect personal attacks, attempts to paint you as unreliable witnesses."

"Which brings us to strategy," Holbrook continues. "Do we go defensive - stick to the facts, don't give them ammunition? Or do we go on the offensive - present our evidence of their violations and put them on the back foot?"

(ooc: titan station is not UES jurisdiction, it's run independently by the director and her team. weyland was said to have a minor role here, some 300 employees, various sponsorships. enough to have a solid presence but not enough to influence the director. UES meanwhile has a tiny office of two or three people, one of whom we met in jonathan park. it's an earth company with these tiny outposts on various stations for logistical purposes.

also you're mistaken about the historical aspect. there should be historical markers in your logs regarding the ues wayfarer taking a contract from weyland to transport xenoarcheological items they were told were inert, but evidently were not. 

look it up and reeducate, then rewrite that last response)

### Entry 285 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-23T14:35:38.502Z]
[OOC: You're absolutely right, and thank you for the correction. Let me clarify the power structure:

- Titan Station: Independent, run by Director Holbrook and her security team
- Weyland Biosystems: Corporate presence (~300 employees, sponsorships) but NO administrative control
- U.E.S.: Tiny logistical outpost (2-3 people including Jonathan Park)

And yes, I found the historical context: The U.E.S. Wayfarer (your previous ship) took a Weyland contract to transport "inert" xenoarchaeological specimens that turned out to be very much NOT inert, leading to the ship's destruction and crew casualties. This is why there's such tension around Weyland's current demands.

Let me rewrite that response properly:]

---

Your compound eyes immediately lock onto the unexpected figure seated at the conference table - Okafor, the potential fourth crew member who was supposed to still be undergoing deep background checks. The sight sends a small jolt of surprise through your system.

The conference room itself is modest but professional - Director Holbrook's domain, not some corporate boardroom. This is Titan Station territory, independent space where Holbrook's word carries the real weight. The handful of Weyland representatives present look distinctly uncomfortable in what is clearly not their turf.

Jonathan Park sits nervously at one end of the table, his small U.E.S. logistical presence dwarfed by the station's authority. He gives you a tentative nod, clearly still processing yesterday's revelations about his employer's true nature.

But it's Okafor's presence that catches your attention most. Commander Torres had said the background check would take time, yet here they are. Either the check was expedited for this crucial meeting, or something has changed dramatically in the security situation.

Director Holbrook notices your reaction to Okafor and gives a slight nod. "Mr. Stargazer, your timing is perfect. We have some developments to discuss before Weyland's representatives arrive."

The weight of the Wayfarer's destruction - those "inert" specimens that cost so many lives - hangs heavy in the air. Whatever Weyland wants now, it won't be as simple as they claim.

he sits down in the closest chair and awaits the director's explanation.

### Entry 287 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-23T14:37:28.292Z]
Dax's compound eyes track to the wall chronometer - 05:50 hours. The weight of the approaching deadline settles over him like a heavy blanket as he finds the nearest chair and lowers himself into it, his four arms folding naturally across his chest and lap.

The conference room has filled with a tense energy. Director Holbrook stands at the head of the polished metal table, her weathered face bearing the kind of expression that comes from years of handling corporate politics and life-or-death decisions. Commander Torres flanks her right side, while Jonathan Park - the U.E.S. Representative - sits rigidly in his formal uniform, clearly uncomfortable with the irregular nature of this entire situation.

Chen and Dr. Yuen take seats nearby, both looking as exhausted as Dax feels despite their attempts to rest. The disabled surveillance drone sits in a sealed evidence container on the side table, its secrets already extracted but serving as a stark reminder of how deep Weyland Biosystems' surveillance network runs.

"Okafor will be joining us shortly," Director Holbrook begins, her voice carrying the authority of someone who's spent decades making hard choices. "His background check cleared faster than expected - clean record, solid references, and frankly, we need all the help we can get."

She activates the room's privacy shields with a gesture, the familiar hum indicating they're now in a secure bubble.

"In ten minutes, Weyland's representatives will walk through that door expecting results. They're going to want answers about the Wanderer incident, explanations for the delays, and most importantly - they're going to want you three handed over for 'debriefing.'" Her eyes meet each of yours in turn. "That's not going to happen on my watch."

Jonathan Park shifts uncomfortably. "Director, we need to be very careful about how we handle this. Weyland Biosystems has significant contracts with both Titan Station and the U.E.S. We can't afford to-"

"Can't afford to what, Representative?" Holbrook's voice cuts through his diplomatic caution like a plasma torch. "Let them disappear three survivors who might be the only witnesses to corporate malfeasance? Who might have evidence of illegal bioweapons research?"

The chronometer ticks to 05:51.

dax shoots park a glare. he's growing tired of UES' corporate nature. he couldn't care less they're his employer - or former employer, sooner or later. he can get a job anywhere he wants. company loyalty was never an interest to him - he's loyal to people. and park's sniveling attitude towards protecting the bottom line shows dax exactly who UES really are.

he turns back to director and thanks her for her protection. the sooner they can secure themselves, the better. getting either weyland or osprey off their backs would be a big weight lifted at this point.

### Entry 289 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-23T14:41:31.577Z]
Your compound eyes narrow as you fix Jonathan Park with a withering stare, all four arms crossing in a gesture of clear disdain. The temperature in the room seems to drop a few degrees as your usual easy-going demeanor evaporates.

"You know what, Park?" you say, your voice carrying an edge that makes even Torres glance up. "I couldn't care less about U.E.S.'s bottom line or corporate image. Never have. Company loyalty?" You let out a bitter laugh. "I'm loyal to *people* - the ones who actually matter. And your sniveling attitude about protecting profit margins while we're fighting for our lives? That shows me exactly what U.E.S. really values."

Park shifts uncomfortably in his chair, his datapad clutched defensively against his chest. "Dax, I'm just trying to—"

"You're trying to cover your ass and the company's," you cut him off, then deliberately turn your back on him to face Director Holbrook. Your posture immediately softens, genuine gratitude replacing the cold anger.

"Director, thank you. For everything - the protection, the resources, treating us like actual people instead of corporate assets. The sooner we can get either Weyland Biosystems or Osprey off our backs, the better. This weight..." you gesture with all four arms, "it's crushing."

Director Holbrook nods grimly. "That's exactly what we're here to discuss. The legal meeting starts in five minutes, but I wanted you to understand - whatever happens in there, we've got contingencies."

Park clears his throat nervously. "The U.E.S. legal team should be arriving any moment to represent your interests..."

dax scoffs but says nothing. in his mind he knows the director's the only one with their interests in mind.

dax asks for one last run through the story - the legal team version.
- we talk openly about what we saw on the ship. the skitterers, the infected, the amalgamation.
- they already know yuen signed off on bringing the cargo on board, with the captain's approval, so no lying there.
- they don't know about the memory block, so we don't mention it.
- they might not know just how much evidence we have to bury them with, so we don't show our hand.

### Entry 291 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-23T14:44:41.686Z]
Dax's compound eyes narrow slightly at Park's corporate maneuvering, but he keeps his thoughts to himself. The Vexian's four arms cross in a gesture that speaks volumes about his opinion of U.E.S. politics.

"Right," Dax says, turning to address the group. "One last run-through of our story - the legal version."

He begins counting off points with his upper hands while his lower arms remain crossed. "First - we're completely open about what we witnessed on the Wanderer. The skitterers, the infected crew, that... thing in the cargo bay. All of it. No point hiding what they probably already know."

"Second," he continues, "Dr. Yuen signed off on the cargo transfer with Captain Morrison's approval. That's documented fact, so we stick to it."

Director Holbrook nods approvingly. "Smart. Honesty where it serves you, silence where it protects you."

"Third," Dax's voice drops slightly, "they don't know about the memory block procedure, so we don't volunteer that information. And fourth..." he glances meaningfully at Torres, "they might not know the full extent of evidence we've gathered. The surveillance footage, the drone data, everything else - we keep that close to our chest unless directly pressed."

Chen shifts nervously. "What if they ask direct questions about things we're not mentioning?"

Dr. Yuen speaks up quietly. "We answer what's asked, nothing more. If they don't ask the right questions..."

"That's their problem," Torres finishes grimly. "This is a legal proceeding, not a confession booth."

The chronometer on the wall shows 0558. Two minutes until Weyland Biosystems' legal team arrives.

Dax settles into one of the conference room chairs, his four arms finding comfortable positions as he takes a few deep breaths. The caffeine is still coursing through his system, but he forces himself to focus on the facts rather than the jittery energy.

*We have the upper hand,* he tells himself, mentally cataloging their advantages. *Director Holbrook controls this station. Torres has military-grade security backing us up. We've got evidence of Weyland's surveillance network. The legal team is walking into our territory, not the other way around.*

The chronometer reads 05:58. Two minutes.

Around him, the atmosphere is tense but controlled. Director Holbrook reviews her notes one final time, her weathered face calm and professional. Commander Torres stands near the door, her security tablet ready and her posture radiating quiet authority. Dr. Yuen and Chen sit nearby, both looking focused despite the early hour.

The surveillance drone components sit in a sealed evidence bag on the table - tangible proof of corporate espionage that Torres's team documented thoroughly. The conference room itself has been swept clean and secured, turned into a digital fortress that no outside signal can penetrate.

*Home turf advantage,* Dax reminds himself as footsteps echo in the corridor outside. *We're playing defense on our own field.*

The door chimes. 06:00 hours exactly.

"They're punctual," Torres murmurs, checking her tablet one last time. "Three individuals approaching - matching the manifest Weyland provided."

**Composure Check: 4 (Critical Failure)**

The moment the door slides open, Dax's caffeine-addled nervous system betrays him completely. What should have been calm, professional confidence instead manifests as visible jittery energy that he can't suppress.

His four arms begin fidgeting independently - upper left drumming fingers on the table, upper right adjusting his gear harness repeatedly, lower arms crossing and uncrossing in his lap. His large compound eyes dart between the entering figures and the evidence bag, then to his companions, then back again in rapid succession.

The three Weyland Biosystems representatives enter with corporate precision: a sharp-suited woman with silver hair who radiates authority, a younger man carrying a briefcase full of legal documents, and a third figure whose cybernetic implants suggest corporate security rather than legal counsel.

"Director Holbrook," the lead woman says smoothly, her eyes immediately cataloging everyone in the room. "I'm Senior Legal Counsel Miranda Kellerman. Thank you for accommodating this early meeting."

Dax tries to project confidence but instead blurts out, "We've got your surveillance drone right here on the table!" His voice carries an edge of caffeinated enthusiasm that makes it sound more like an accusation than a professional statement.

The room falls silent. Kellerman's eyebrows raise slightly as her gaze shifts to the evidence bag, then to Dax's clearly agitated state.

Director Holbrook shoots Dax a warning look before addressing their guests. "Please, have a seat. We have several matters to discuss regarding the U.E.S. Wanderer incident."

Dax sinks deeper into his chair, his four arms folding tightly against his torso as he mentally kicks himself for the earlier coffee disaster and his hyperactive behavior. *Smooth, Stargazer. Really professional showing there,* he thinks, his compound eyes fixed on the polished conference table surface.

He forces himself to remain still and silent, fighting against the lingering caffeine jitters that want to make him fidget or contribute unnecessarily to the conversation. This is Director Holbrook's domain, her expertise, and he knows better than to interfere with someone who clearly knows how to handle corporate legal teams.

The Vexian tech-scout focuses on listening intently, cataloging every detail of what's being said while keeping his mouth firmly shut. His engineering mind continues to process the technical implications of what they've discovered, but he restrains himself from blurting out observations or suggestions.

*Let the director work,* he tells himself. *She's got this under control. Just stay quiet, stay alert, and be ready if she needs technical backup.*

Director Holbrook continues to methodically dismantle the Weyland legal team's arguments, her calm authority filling the room. Dax finds himself genuinely impressed by her tactical approach - she's treating this less like a negotiation and more like a controlled demolition of their corporate leverage.

Dax's compound eyes shift subtly from the polished conference table to his companions, trying to gauge their emotional state without drawing attention from the Weyland legal team currently locked in tense negotiation with Director Holbrook.

Chen sits with her back straight, arms crossed defensively, but there's a steadiness to her posture that suggests she's holding up well. Her engineer's mind seems to be tracking every detail of the corporate maneuvering, occasionally making brief notes on her datapad. When she catches Dax's glance, she gives him the slightest nod - professional, controlled, but reassuring.

Dr. Yuen appears more visibly strained, her hands gripping her wheelchair's armrests with white knuckles. The weight of being the one who initially signed off on the cargo transport is clearly eating at her, despite the legal team's assurances that she followed proper protocols. Still, her jaw is set with determination, and when the Weyland attorney tries to imply negligence on her part, she responds with clinical precision that shuts down the accusation immediately.

Director Holbrook continues to dominate the room with quiet authority, systematically dismantling each of Weyland's attempts to shift blame or minimize their corporate responsibility. Her legal team flanks the corporate representatives like experienced predators, and Dax can see why she's maintained independence on Titan Station for so long.

**Insight Check: 7 (Failure)**

Despite Dax's best efforts to read the corporate dynamics, the lingering effects of his caffeine overdose combined with his natural difficulty interpreting human social cues leaves him struggling to parse the subtle interactions between the Weyland Biosystems legal team.

The three corporate representatives - two humans in identical dark suits and a third figure whose species Dax can't immediately identify - seem to operate with practiced coordination, but the nuances of their hierarchy and internal tensions remain opaque to him. He catches fragments of body language that suggest disagreement or stress, but can't piece together whether it's directed at each other, at the situation, or simply professional frustration with Director Holbrook's masterful legal maneuvering.

What Dax *can* clearly observe is that Director Holbrook continues to maintain complete control of the proceedings. Her voice carries across the conference room with unwavering authority as she addresses the lead Weyland attorney.

"Mr. Kellerman, your client's attempts to characterize this as a routine cargo dispute are becoming increasingly transparent," she states coolly. "We have documented evidence of unauthorized surveillance equipment, corporate espionage activities, and now threats from third-party security contractors. This goes far beyond standard liability concerns."

The Weyland team exchanges glances that Dax wishes he could interpret more clearly, but their poker faces remain frustratingly unreadable to his jittery, overcaffeinated perception.

Dax remains frozen in his chair, his four arms now completely still as he watches the verbal chess match unfold between Director Holbrook and the Weyland Biosystems legal team. The room crackles with professional tension and political maneuvering that's far beyond his technical expertise.

The lead Weyland attorney - a sharp-featured woman in an immaculate corporate suit - gestures toward a holographic display of legal precedents while speaking in measured, calculated tones about "contractual obligations" and "corporate property rights." Her words feel like precision instruments designed to slice through any defense.

Director Holbrook responds with equal composure, her weathered hands folded calmly on the table as she cites station sovereignty protocols and witness protection statutes. The director's presence fills the room with quiet authority that makes even the corporate lawyers pause before responding.

Dax finds himself caught between admiration for Holbrook's masterful handling of the situation and anxiety about his own potential contributions. His compound eyes dart between the legal documents being displayed and his companions, ready to jump in if any technical questions arise about the Wanderer's systems, the cargo containers, or the surveillance evidence they've uncovered.

The caffeine still coursing through his system makes him hyper-aware of every word, every gesture, every subtle shift in the room's dynamics. He grips the edge of his chair, prepared to speak if called upon but grateful that the director seems to have everything under control.

The tension in Conference Room 7-Alpha reaches a crescendo as Director Holbrook leans back in her chair, her weathered face displaying the kind of satisfied expression that comes from holding all the winning cards.

"Mr. Kellerman," she says, her voice carrying the authority of someone who's spent decades managing corporate politics, "I think we've established the facts quite clearly. Your clients transported dangerous xenobiological specimens without proper disclosure, resulting in the deaths of seventeen crew members. My station's investigation has uncovered evidence of corporate surveillance operations and intimidation tactics."

The lead Weyland attorney - a sharp-featured woman in an expensive suit - shifts uncomfortably. "Director, we're prepared to discuss reasonable compensation for the survivors' cooperation in our internal review process."

"Cooperation?" Holbrook's eyebrows rise. "These three individuals are material witnesses under station protection. They're not available for your 'internal review.'"

Dax watches the exchange with growing confidence, realizing that Director Holbrook isn't just protecting them - she's systematically dismantling Weyland's legal position. The caffeine jitters have finally settled enough for him to focus on the technical aspects being discussed.

When the Weyland attorney mentions "equipment malfunction" as a potential cause for the Wanderer's crisis, Dax feels his four hands clench involuntarily. He knows the technical details better than anyone in this room, and that claim is complete fabrication.

The moment Dax hears "equipment malfunction," his professional integrity overrides his nervousness. His four arms unfold as he leans forward, his technical expertise finally finding its moment.

"That's completely false," Dax says, his voice cutting through the legal posturing with quiet authority. "I maintained every system on the Wanderer for three years. Every diagnostic, every maintenance cycle, every component replacement."

The Weyland attorney turns toward him with obvious irritation. "Mr. Stargazer, you're not qualified to—"

"WB-7734 containment units," Dax interrupts, his compound eyes fixed on her with unwavering focus. "That's what your client provided. I have the maintenance logs, the power consumption data, the environmental readings. Those units didn't malfunction - they were *designed* to fail."

He gestures with his upper arms while his lower hands access his personal datapad. "The bio-seals showed systematic degradation patterns consistent with programmed obsolescence. The power regulators were rated for continuous operation but failed after exactly 72 hours. That's not malfunction - that's intentional engineering."

Director Holbrook's expression shows quiet satisfaction as Dax systematically dismantles the corporate narrative. "Mr. Stargazer, please continue."

"The atmospheric processors detected the breach twelve hours before containment failure," Dax continues, his technical confidence now fully engaged. "Standard protocol would have been immediate emergency protocols. But the Weyland systems were configured to suppress those alerts until catastrophic failure was inevitable."

The lead attorney's composure finally cracks. "These are serious accusations without proper documentation—"

"I have the documentation," Dax says simply. "Every log file, every diagnostic report, every maintenance record. The Wanderer's systems were sabotaged by design."

### Entry 309 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-24T01:38:01.762Z]
Dax settles back into his chair with renewed composure, the earlier caffeine jitters finally subsiding into a steady focus. His four arms find natural positions - upper pair resting on the table's edge, lower pair folded calmly in his lap. The pride in his chest is quiet but genuine as he watches Director Holbrook systematically dismantle Weyland's legal position.

*That surveillance drone data made all the difference,* he thinks, allowing himself a moment of satisfaction. His technical expertise had provided exactly the leverage the Director needed to turn this from a defensive scramble into a commanding offensive.

The Weyland legal team is now visibly struggling. Kellerman keeps glancing at his tablet, searching for angles that simply aren't there anymore. The junior attorney has gone pale, clearly realizing how badly they've underestimated Titan Station's capabilities.

Director Holbrook continues her methodical presentation, each piece of evidence building an unassailable case. Chen and Dr. Yuen remain professionally attentive, but Dax can see the relief beginning to show in their posture. This isn't just going well - it's going perfectly.

"Furthermore," Holbrook says, sliding another data pad across the table, "we have complete records of your surveillance network's activities over the past 72 hours. Including attempted infiltration of secure diplomatic quarters."

Kellerman's face goes ashen as he reviews the technical specifications that Dax had painstakingly extracted from the drone.

dax shoots a smug look over at kellerman, recalling the hundreds of unanswered calls the trio ignored. "i assume i don't need to tell you what we think of your proposed 'individual deals', kellerman" he says.

### Entry 311 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-24T01:50:52.077Z]
Dax's compound eyes fix on Kellerman with unmistakable satisfaction, his four arms settling into a relaxed but confident posture. The memory of those 73 blocked calls - desperate attempts to divide and conquer the trio - fills him with a sense of vindication.

"I assume I don't need to tell you what we think of your proposed 'individual deals', Kellerman," he says, his voice carrying just enough edge to make it clear how thoroughly unimpressed he was by the corporate maneuvering.

Kellerman's professional composure cracks slightly, a muscle in his jaw twitching as he's reminded of his failed intimidation campaign. The other Weyland attorneys exchange quick glances - clearly they weren't fully briefed on the extent of their colleague's desperate attempts to break up the witnesses' united front.

Director Holbrook raises an eyebrow, looking between Dax and Kellerman with renewed interest. "Individual deals? Mr. Kellerman, I wasn't aware Weyland Biosystems was attempting to circumvent our official proceedings with unauthorized contact."

"Those were... preliminary discussions," Kellerman says stiffly, his earlier confidence now noticeably shaken.

Chen leans forward slightly, a cold smile playing at her lips. "Seventy-three blocked calls in two days doesn't sound very 'preliminary' to me."

The room's atmosphere shifts decisively in favor of the survivors as Weyland's legal strategy continues to unravel under scrutiny.

dax feels emboldened by chen's addition. he's confident they're doing the right thing going all-out against weyland - he could not care less about making an enemy of them.
but at the back of his mind tugs that little thought - it's not weyland they need to be afraid of. it's their money that's paying osprey to hunt them.
he ruminates quietly as the legal meeting wraps up.

### Entry 313 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-24T01:53:40.196Z]
Dax feels a surge of confidence as Chen's words reinforce their united front. His four arms settle into a more relaxed position, the satisfaction of watching Weyland Biosystems' legal strategy crumble filling him with vindication. *We're doing the right thing,* he thinks, his compound eyes tracking the increasingly frustrated expressions on the corporate lawyers' faces.

The pride in standing up to corporate bullying warms his chest. Weyland can add his name to whatever blacklist they want - he's never cared about making enemies of companies that value profit over lives. His technical skills are in demand across the galaxy, and his conscience is worth more than any corporate contract.

But even as the legal victory unfolds before them, that nagging worry gnaws at the edge of his thoughts like a persistent system alert. Weyland Biosystems might be retreating from this conference room with their legal tails between their legs, but they're not the real threat. They're just the client writing the checks.

*Osprey Security Solutions.* The name sends a chill down his spine despite the warm satisfaction of the moment. Corporate lawyers can be defeated with evidence and jurisdiction. But Osprey operates in the shadows, beyond the reach of station security and diplomatic immunity. They don't care about legal precedent or proper procedure - they care about results, and they have 30 hours left to deliver them.

As Director Holbrook delivers what sounds like closing remarks to the Weyland team, Dax finds himself mentally cataloging escape routes and contingency plans, his earlier confidence tempered by the cold reality of what's still coming.

### Entry 315 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-24T01:55:20.020Z]
Dax catches Director Holbrook's attention as the Weyland legal team begins gathering their materials, his four arms gesturing subtly toward the door. His voice drops to a low, urgent whisper that only carries to their side of the table.

"Director, I'd suggest we hold back for a moment," he says, his compound eyes tracking the corporate representatives as they prepare to leave. "Let them get escorted out first. I'm... concerned about what might be waiting for us out there."

The weight of Osprey's 48-hour ultimatum - now down to roughly 30 hours - hangs heavy in his mind. The surveillance drone, the biological profiling capabilities, the quantum data extraction technology they'd discovered. This level of corporate espionage suggests resources and planning that go far beyond simple legal maneuvering.

Director Holbrook's weathered face shows understanding as she catches his meaning. "Commander Torres," she says quietly, "please ensure our guests are fully escorted to the station exit before we conclude our business here."

Kellerman pauses at the door, his sharp features twisted with barely concealed frustration. "This isn't over, Director. Weyland Biosystems has significant investments in this sector."

"Yes," Holbrook replies coolly, "and they'll continue to have them - under proper oversight and regulation."

As the door slides shut behind the Weyland team, Dax feels his shoulders tense. The legal victory feels hollow when measured against the very real threat of corporate mercenaries operating on a timeline.

Dax's compound eyes narrow as his enhanced Vexian senses pick up subtle details that would escape most beings. Through the conference room's sealed door, he detects the faint vibration patterns of footsteps - but not just Torres escorting the Weyland team.

"Wait," he whispers urgently, his four arms tensing. "There are additional people in the corridor. At least three extra sets of footsteps, moving with military precision. They're positioned at strategic intervals - one near the lift junction, one by the emergency access, one covering the main thoroughfare."

His voice drops even lower as more details filter through his heightened awareness. "The Weyland team stopped moving about thirty seconds ago. They should be at the station exit by now, but I can still hear Kellerman's voice - he's talking to someone new."

Director Holbrook's expression hardens. "Osprey?"

"Has to be," Dax confirms, his technical mind automatically cataloging the tactical implications. "They're using the legal meeting as cover for positioning assets. Classic corporate security play - establish legitimate presence, then expand operational footprint."

Chen and Dr. Yuen exchange worried glances as the reality sinks in. The legal victory was just the opening gambit.

"Director," Dax continues, his four arms now moving in subtle gestures as he processes the acoustic data, "whatever we do next, we can't leave through the main corridors. They've got us boxed in."

**Intelligence Check: 13 (Success)**

Dax's mind races through the technical schematics he's absorbed during his time on Titan Station. His four arms gesture as he recalls the maintenance layouts, emergency protocols, and service corridors that most people never notice.

"Wait," he says quietly, his compound eyes focusing as the mental blueprints align. "There's a maintenance shaft behind the environmental controls panel. It connects to the secondary life support conduits - runs parallel to the main corridors but completely isolated from foot traffic."

He points toward the far wall where a discrete access panel sits flush with the bulkhead. "That shaft leads to three different exit points: the engineering section, the hydroponics bay, or..." his voice drops to barely above a whisper, "the security command center where Torres's backup team should be stationed."

Director Holbrook nods approvingly. "The security center would be our best bet. My people need to know about this Osprey deployment immediately."

Chen examines the access panel with her engineer's eye. "It'll be a tight fit, especially for all of us moving together, but it's definitely navigable."

Dr. Yuen checks her medical kit. "How long is the crawl?"

"Maybe ten minutes if we move carefully," Dax estimates, his technical knowledge filling in the details. "The shaft has standard atmospheric recycling, so we won't suffocate, but we need to stay quiet. Sound carries through the ventilation system."

Outside, the footsteps continue their methodical patrol pattern, confirming that Osprey has indeed established a perimeter around their position.

Dax's compound eyes dart to Dr. Yuen, noting the subtle tremor in her hands and the way she's been favoring her left side since the Wanderer incident. The xenobiologist has been putting on a brave front, but the psychological and physical trauma from her encounter with the skitterers is still taking its toll.

"Commander Torres," he whispers, his voice barely audible as he gestures with one of his lower arms toward Yuen. "Can you help Dr. Yuen? She's still recovering from... what happened on the ship."

Torres nods immediately, her military training recognizing both the tactical necessity and humanitarian need. She moves to Yuen's side, offering a steady arm for support while maintaining her weapon ready with her free hand.

Director Holbrook takes point, her hand resting on her sidearm as she approaches the sealed door. The conference room's emergency lighting casts long shadows across their faces as they prepare to navigate whatever Osprey operatives might be waiting in the corridors beyond.

"Command center is three levels up," Holbrook whispers. "Service corridors will be our best bet - less predictable than main thoroughfares."

The group moves through Titan Station's service corridors with remarkable coordination. Dax's four-armed advantage proves invaluable as he silently adjusts loose equipment and guides the others around potential noise hazards. His enhanced Vexian hearing tracks the distant sounds of normal station operations, filtering out routine maintenance hums from potential threats.

Commander Torres proves equally adept, her military training evident in how she supports Dr. Yuen while maintaining tactical awareness. The xenobiologist, despite her lingering trauma, follows their lead with quiet determination.

Director Holbrook navigates the maze of maintenance passages with the confidence of someone who knows every bolt and rivet of her station. She leads them through a series of increasingly narrow corridors, past humming life support systems and quietly clicking data conduits.

"Two more levels," Holbrook whispers as they reach a service lift. The cramped space forces them into close quarters, but Dax's compound eyes continue scanning for threats through the lift's small observation window.

As they ascend, the distant sound of heavy footsteps echoes from the main corridors - systematic, methodical, clearly searching. The Osprey operatives are definitely on the station, but so far the service routes have kept the group undetected.

The lift stops with a soft chime. Beyond the door lies the final stretch to the command center - and the security of Holbrook's inner sanctum.

Torres nods and moves ahead, pressing herself against the corridor wall as she peers around the corner toward the final stretch leading to the security center. The station's emergency lighting casts long shadows that could hide potential threats.

"The corridor looks clear," Torres reports in barely audible tones, "but I can't see the security center entrance from this angle. There could be hostiles positioned just outside our visual range."

She taps her wrist communicator, checking for signal strength. "I might be able to establish a short-range encrypted channel to the security team, but any transmission risks giving away our position if Osprey has monitoring equipment in place."

Dax carefully shifts Dr. Yuen's weight to his upper arms while his lower hands work with practiced precision on his portable tech kit. His compound eyes track the corridor while his fingers dance across a compact signal analyzer, quickly identifying the cleanest frequency channels.

"Give me thirty seconds," he whispers, pulling out a hair-thin fiber optic cable and a micro-transmitter no larger than his thumbnail. His technical expertise, combined with his natural Vexian dexterity, allows him to jury-rig a directional, ultra-low-power communication array using Torres's wrist communicator as a base.

The device hums almost inaudibly as it establishes a tight-beam encrypted link. Within moments, a familiar voice crackles through Torres's earpiece - barely audible but clear.

"Security Center to Commander Torres. We've been monitoring unusual activity. Three unidentified individuals in tactical gear positioned outside Conference Room 7-Alpha approximately four minutes ago. They're not station personnel."

Dax's modification allows the signal to remain completely undetectable to standard monitoring equipment, the communication bouncing through the station's own infrastructure in a way that mimics routine maintenance data.

"Copy that," Torres whispers back. "What's your tactical assessment? Can you provide safe passage to the security center?"

"Negative on safe passage. We're tracking at least six hostiles total - three at your former position, three more between your current location and us. Recommend you hold position while we coordinate a response."

**Perception Check: 17 (Success)**

Dax's enhanced Vexian senses pick up the subtle vibrations of approaching footsteps through the station's metal flooring - two sets, moving with practiced stealth but not quite silent enough to escape his compound eyes and sensitive hearing. The rhythm suggests tactical training, coordinated movement patterns designed to sweep and clear.

"Contact," he whispers urgently, his four arms instinctively shifting Dr. Yuen's weight while his lower hands reach for his equipment. "Two hostiles, approaching from the maintenance junction ahead. Sixty seconds out, moving in formation."

Commander Torres immediately signals for silence, her hand moving to her sidearm as she processes the tactical situation. Through the modified communicator, her security team's voice crackles with tension.

"Security Center confirms - we're seeing movement on internal sensors. Osprey team is conducting a systematic sweep of your sector. They're using military-grade signal jammers, but your jury-rigged comm array is bypassing their interference."

Director Holbrook's weathered face hardens with resolve. "This is my station," she whispers fiercely. "These corporate mercenaries have no authority here."

The approaching footsteps grow closer, their tactical boots creating a distinct pattern against the deck plating. Dax can hear the faint electronic hum of advanced scanning equipment - they're not just searching visually, they're using tech to detect heat signatures and electronic devices.

Dr. Yuen grips Dax's arm tighter, her medical training warring with the trauma of recent events. The confined space suddenly feels much smaller as the reality of armed pursuit closes in.

dax laments the lack of firepower on their side. they let him keep his empty firearm, but chen's shotgun was seized, and yuen never had anything remotely like a weapon. he looks at torres and the large gun in her hands, hoping it's enough. he's not sure what the director has on her, but there's no way she came here empty handed.
he thinks about how he can possibly help...
he asks torres if there's any electronic defenses he could activate via a hack through his datapad.

### Entry 333 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-24T13:03:30.915Z]
Dax's compound eyes sweep over their small group, taking tactical inventory with growing unease. His empty sidearm feels like dead weight on his hip - a cruel reminder of their vulnerability. Chen's confiscated shotgun would have been invaluable right now, and Dr. Yuen's complete lack of combat training leaves her entirely dependent on their protection.

"Commander," he whispers urgently, his lower hands already pulling out his portable datapad while his upper arms continue supporting Dr. Yuen. "What kind of electronic defenses does this section have? Emergency blast doors, security barriers, automated systems?"

His fingers hover over the device's interface, ready to work. "I might not be much with a gun, but I can make the station itself fight for us. Lockdown protocols, environmental controls, even basic things like cutting power to specific sections or activating emergency lighting patterns to disorient hostiles."

Torres glances at his datapad, her tactical mind immediately grasping the potential. "There are emergency containment systems throughout this corridor network," she says quietly. "Blast doors every fifty meters, atmospheric isolation protocols, and..." her eyes narrow as she considers the possibilities, "the fire suppression system could create visual cover if we need it."

Director Holbrook shifts slightly, and Dax catches a glimpse of something metallic beneath her jacket - she definitely came prepared for trouble.

**Technology Check: 20 (Exceptional Success)**

Dax's datapad comes alive with cascading displays as his fingers dance across the interface with practiced expertise. The station's defensive grid unfolds before him like a three-dimensional chess board, each system responding to his commands with satisfying precision.

"Perfect," he breathes, his compound eyes tracking multiple data streams simultaneously. "I'm in deep - got administrative access to the entire emergency response network for this sector."

His lower hands work the controls while his upper arms continue steadying Dr. Yuen, who watches the technical display with fascination despite their precarious situation. The datapad's screen shows a comprehensive map of their corridor section, with defensive assets highlighted in tactical blue.

"Commander Torres, I've got full control over blast door sequences, atmospheric controls, and emergency lighting," Dax reports quietly. "But here's the beautiful part - I can also access the maintenance drone network. There are three heavy-duty repair units in this section that I can redirect for... creative purposes."

Torres's eyebrows raise with professional appreciation. "Maintenance drones as improvised weapons?"

"Exactly. They're equipped with plasma cutters and magnetic grappling systems. Won't stop a determined assault team, but they'll definitely slow them down and give us early warning." Dax's fingers continue their work, establishing secure command protocols. "I'm also setting up a cascading lockdown sequence - if we need to retreat, I can seal sections behind us automatically."

Director Holbrook nods approvingly. "Excellent work, Dax. Now we have options beyond just running."

The datapad chimes softly as the defensive network comes fully online, ready to respond to Dax's commands at a moment's notice.

he looks to torres, hoping she'll take advantage of the distraction to lead them out and get a first look, and tactical advantage, over what's come for them.

### Entry 337 - ASSISTANT [2025-09-24T14:55:40.493Z]
**Technology Check: 20 (Exceptional Success) - Continued**

The maintenance drones respond to Dax's commands with mechanical precision, their plasma torches flaring to dangerous overcharge levels as they race through the station's service corridors toward the strike team's position. His datapad displays their progress in real-time - three units converging on the intruders' location with industrial-grade cutting tools now weaponized into makeshift plasma cannons.

"Drones deployed," Dax whispers urgently, his compound eyes tracking the tactical display. "Thirty seconds until contact. They'll have to deal with superheated plasma cutters coming at them from three directions."

Commander Torres nods grimly, her assault rifle at ready position as she processes the tactical advantage. "Perfect timing, Stargazer. That'll force them to take cover and reveal their positions."

She signals to Director Holbrook, who draws a compact sidearm with practiced ease. "We move on my mark," Torres whispers. "Stay low, stay quiet, and let me get eyes on what we're dealing with first."

The distant sound of plasma discharge echoes through the station corridors, followed immediately by shouts of alarm and the sharp crack of return fire. Torres's expression hardens with professional satisfaction.

"Now we see what kind of professionals Osprey sent us," she murmurs, preparing to lead them toward the conflict zone.

**Technology Check: 18 (Success)**

The maintenance drones surge forward like mechanical wasps, their plasma torches blazing with dangerous overcharged energy as they streak toward the strike team's position. Dax's fingers continue their precise dance across his datapad, coordinating the swarm with tactical precision.

"Torres, now!" he calls out, his compound eyes tracking multiple drone feeds simultaneously. "They're focused on the mechanical threat - perfect distraction window!"

Commander Torres doesn't hesitate. She moves with fluid military precision, using the chaos of sparking drones and shouting voices to lead their small group toward a secondary corridor junction. Her weapon remains ready as she signals for the others to follow.

The strike team's voices echo through the corridors - sharp commands about "neutralizing mechanical threats" and "maintaining primary objective focus." The overcharged plasma torches create brilliant flashes that temporarily overwhelm their tactical visors, buying precious seconds.

Dr. Yuen stays close to Dax's supporting arms, her breathing still slightly labored but her steps steady. Chen moves with engineer's efficiency, her confiscated equipment sorely missed but her tactical awareness sharp.

"Maintenance shaft access point, thirty meters ahead," Torres whispers urgently, her military training evident in how she processes multiple escape routes simultaneously. "We can bypass their sweep pattern entirely."

The mechanical distraction continues to draw attention as Dax's drone swarm executes their programmed harassment protocols, creating exactly the kind of technical chaos that gives them the tactical advantage they desperately need.

**Technology Check: 19 (Success)**

Dax's fingers dance across his datapad with mechanical precision, his enhanced Vexian reflexes calculating trajectories and timing with split-second accuracy. The maintenance drones streak through the corridor like angry metallic wasps, their overcharged plasma torches casting wild shadows on the walls as they bear down on the Osprey strike team.

"Three... two... NOW!" Dax calls out, his voice cutting through the chaos.

The blast doors slam shut with a thunderous clang just as the lead Osprey operative dives backward, the heavy reinforced barriers separating the strike team from Dax's group by mere inches. Through the security feeds on his datapad, Dax watches the corporate soldiers scramble to avoid his weaponized maintenance drones, their tactical formation dissolving into defensive chaos.

"Beautiful timing," Commander Torres breathes, her assault rifle still trained on the sealed blast door. "That bought us maybe ten minutes before they find another route."

Dr. Yuen sags with relief against Dax's supporting arms, her breathing still labored from the stress. "How many ways can they get to the security center?" she asks weakly.

Torres's expression darkens as she checks her tactical display. "Too many. We need to move - now. There's a service corridor two levels down that connects to the main security hub. If we can reach it before they regroup..."

Dax's compound eyes track the drone feeds on his datapad, watching the Osprey operatives regrouping beyond the blast doors. "The drones won't hold them long," he reports grimly. "They're already adapting their tactics."

The weight of their situation settles over the small group - they're still trapped on a station where corporate mercenaries are hunting them, with limited firepower and a wounded team member who can barely walk.

**Technology Check: 19 (Success) - Continued**

The blast doors slam shut with a thunderous clang that reverberates through the maintenance corridor, the heavy durasteel barriers sealing off their pursuers just as the overcharged maintenance drones streak past in a blaze of plasma fire. Through his datapad's security feeds, Dax watches the Osprey strike team dive for cover as his mechanical swarm forces them to retreat.

"Perfect timing," Torres breathes, her military training evident in how quickly she processes the tactical advantage. "That bought us maybe three minutes before they find another route."

Dax's compound eyes track their position on his datapad's station schematic, his enhanced Vexian spatial awareness calculating distances and routes with mechanical precision. "You're absolutely right," he says, his confidence returning as the tactical situation becomes clearer. "Home turf advantage - we know every maintenance shaft, every emergency protocol, every defensive system."

He gestures toward the corridor ahead with one of his upper arms while his lower hands continue coordinating the drone swarm. "Security Center Alpha is less than two hundred meters through this service route. Torres's team has military-grade equipment, hardened positions, and direct control over station defenses."

Dr. Yuen, still leaning against his support, manages a weak but determined smile. "And once we're there, Osprey loses their mobility advantage. They can't exactly storm a fortified security center without declaring war on Titan Station itself."

Torres nods grimly, checking her weapon's charge level. "The Director's emergency protocols are already in effect. The moment we reach the security center, this becomes an official station defense situation. Osprey will have to explain to a lot of very important people why they're conducting military operations against civilian researchers."

Dax feels the familiar surge of confidence that comes from having a solid technical plan. "Then let's move. My drones can provide rear guard coverage, and I've got override access to every emergency system between here and safety."

**Movement Through Titan Station - Continued**

The group moves with practiced coordination through the maintenance corridors, their footsteps muffled by the sound-dampening materials Torres had specified during the station's security upgrades. Dax smoothly transitions from his technical support role to physical assistance, his four arms providing steady, reassuring support to Dr. Yuen.

"Easy does it," he whispers, his upper arms guiding her carefully around a junction of exposed conduits while his lower hands remain ready to catch her if she stumbles. The xenobiologist accepts his help gratefully, her breathing still showing traces of the stress from their recent escape.

Commander Torres moves ahead with military precision, her assault rifle held in a ready position as she checks each intersection before waving the group forward. The blast doors behind them remain sealed, but the distant sounds of cutting tools echo through the station's superstructure - their pursuers haven't given up.

"Security center is two more corridors," Torres reports quietly, her voice barely audible over the ambient station noise. "But we need to cross through a more exposed section ahead. Main thoroughfare intersection - multiple sight lines, harder to control."

Dr. Yuen's grip tightens slightly on Dax's supporting arm as they approach the challenging section. The weight of their situation - hunted by corporate mercenaries, racing against time, dependent on reaching sanctuary - presses down on the small group as they prepare for the final push to safety.

**Movement Through Titan Station - Continued**

Dax's compound eyes shift to Chen as they move through the maintenance corridor, his upper arms still providing steady support to Dr. Yuen while his lower hands remain ready to react to threats. 

Chen moves with the determined stride of someone who's spent years navigating crisis situations in engineering departments. Her jaw is set with quiet resolve, and despite the stress lines around her eyes, there's no tremor in her hands or hesitation in her step. She catches Dax's concerned glance and gives him a brief but reassuring nod - the kind of wordless communication that's developed between the trio over their months together.

"I'm good," she whispers, her voice barely audible but carrying that steady engineer's confidence. "Just thinking through contingencies. Torres knows these corridors better than anyone - if there's a way through, she'll find it."

Commander Torres continues to lead them with practiced stealth, her military bearing evident in every calculated movement. The security chief periodically raises her hand in silent signals, guiding the group around potential noise hazards and through the safest routes toward the security center.

The distant hum of Titan Station's life support systems masks their footsteps as they navigate deeper into the maintenance sections, getting closer to their destination with each careful step.
