## HISTORICAL CAMPAIGN LOG (Part 2) (Pre-Enhanced Server)
*[Continued from part 1]*

```
So yes - you can plug your medical scanner into that port in the Central Hub to recharge it! But that means going back through the Hub to reach it. The scanner is currently dead in your inventory, but it could be recharged if you return to that console.
That's actually a great tactical consideration. The scanner could:

Detect life signs (find survivors or threats)
Analyze that heat signature below before you descend
Get more data on the alien biology if you encounter another creature

Do you want to:

Head back to Central Hub first to recharge the scanner
Go straight down to the storage bay without it
Take a different path entirely

What's Dax thinking?

player: ah shit, i didn't actually charge it hah. fuck.
okay, dax confirmed on the terminal exactly where the heat signature is coming from, in relation to him, this room, and the storage 

claude: You turn back to the console, your fingers dancing across the interface to bring up the thermal sensor array. The system is damaged, but functional enough to give you a clearer picture.
The display refreshes, showing a cross-section of Engineering:
Your Position: Main Engineering deck, at the primary console.
The Heat Signature: It's not in the storage bay itself. It's in the maintenance shaft that runs parallel to the ladder well, about halfway down between your level and the storage level below. The signature is stationary now, body-temperature, roughly human-sized. It's been moving intermittently - sometimes completely still for minutes, then shifting position slightly.
Storage Bay Status: The actual storage bay shows cold - no heat signatures, no movement. The Plasma Injector should be in a sealed cabinet down there.
The maintenance shaft has an access panel on each level. There's one here on your deck (currently sealed), and another in the storage bay below. Whatever's in that shaft could emerge at either level... or might just be hiding.
Your tactical situation is clearer now:

The thing in the shaft seems to be alive but not actively hunting
You could potentially bypass it by moving quickly down the ladder
Or you could investigate the maintenance panel on this level first
The storage bay itself appears clear

The engineering instincts in you note that if it's human-sized and body-temperature, it could be another survivor in hiding. Or it could be something else entirely wearing a human shape.
What's your move?

player: dax recalls the previous creature made a chitinous clicking sound before it was ever alerted to his presence. he attempts to listen out for the same sound, focusing in on it, locking out the other sounds of the 

claude: You close your eyes, letting your Vexian senses sharpen in the darkness. Your breathing slows. The background hum of the emergency generators fades. The distant groan of settling metal becomes white noise. You're listening for that specific sound - that wet, chitinous click-clack that haunted you through the corridors.
Roll for Perception to filter out the ship's ambient noise and detect any creature sounds.
Rolling Wisdom (Perception)...
d20 Roll: 16
Your Wisdom Modifier: +1
Total: 17 (Success!)
Your multifaceted ears, evolved for the subtle acoustic environment of Vexian caverns, parse the layers of sound with remarkable clarity.
You hear:

The steady thrum of life support
A faint drip of condensation somewhere above
The occasional spark from damaged conduits
Your own heartbeat

But NO chittering. No clicking. No scraping of chitin on metal.
Instead, from the maintenance shaft, you catch something else entirely: a soft, ragged breathing. Labored. Human or near-human. And underneath it, barely audible, a whispered mantra being repeated:
"...seven three five five... seven three five five... seven three five five..."
The same numbers from Officer Rostova's armory code. Over and over.
This isn't a Skitterer. This is a person. A survivor. And they sound like they're in bad shape - physically or mentally or both.
The maintenance access panel is 15 meters away, secured with a standard manual release wheel.
What does Dax do?

player: (ey, woah, appreciate it but ask me to roll, remember?)oh fuck. dax sneaks back into the hub as quick as he can to charge his med scanner and returns to the engi 

claude: You're right - let me fix that! I should ask you to roll, not roll for you.

You close your eyes, letting your Vexian senses sharpen in the darkness. Your breathing slows as you try to filter out the ship's ambient noise and focus on any telltale creature sounds.
Roll a Perception check (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to see what you can hear.
Once you tell me what you rolled, I'll let you know what Dax picks up!
But first - you mentioned sneaking back to the Hub to charge the scanner. Smart move! The trek back through the massive Engineering bay to the door is tense but uneventful. You slip into the Central Hub, finding Officer Rostova's body still where you left it behind the console. The emergency diagnostic port glows with that faint green light.
You plug in the medical scanner. It takes about 30 seconds to charge enough for basic functionality. The device hums back to life, its small screen showing a battery indicator slowly filling.
Now, returning to Engineering with your newly charged scanner, you pause at the threshold. That heat signature is still on the thermal readings, still in the maintenance shaft between levels.
Want to make that Perception check now to listen for what's in the shaft? Roll when ready!

player: (it was Perception check: 14 +1 = 

claude: Perception check: 15 (Success!)
Standing in the doorway of Engineering, your scanner charged and ready, you filter through the ship's cacophony of dying sounds. Your Vexian hearing picks up something that makes your blood run cold.
From the maintenance shaft, there's no chittering or clicking. Instead, you hear ragged, labored breathing - definitely humanoid. And underneath it, a barely audible whispered mantra:
"...seven three five five... seven three five five... seven three five five..."
Officer Rostova's armory code. Someone down there knows it. Someone who sounds hurt, terrified, or possibly losing their mind.
You now have your charged medical scanner in hand. The maintenance access panel is about 15 meters away from your position, a standard manual release wheel securing it. The thermal readings still show the figure hasn't moved from their position in the shaft between levels.
Your options are clearer now:

Use the scanner to get a reading through the maintenance panel (might tell you if they're injured, human, infected, etc.)
Open the panel and make contact
Ignore them and head straight down the ladder to the storage bay
Try to communicate through the panel first

What does Dax do?

player: dax tries to get an angle to scan them from a distance without being 

claude: You move with practiced stealth, keeping to the shadows cast by the massive reactor housing. The medical scanner's weight is reassuring in your hand - finally, a chance to know what you're dealing with before it knows about you.
The maintenance shaft has ventilation grates at regular intervals along the wall. You identify one that should give you a good angle while keeping you concealed behind a bank of cooling pipes. From there, you could potentially scan through the grate without revealing your position.
Getting there without making noise will require careful movement across the debris-strewn engineering deck.
Roll a Stealth check (d20 + your Dexterity modifier of +4) to see if you can get into position without alerting whoever's in the shaft.
What do you roll?

player: shit, Stealth check: 9 (rolled 

claude: Stealth check: 9 (Failure)
You begin creeping along the wall, using the cooling pipes for cover. Your four hands carefully place each step, avoiding the larger pieces of debris. You're halfway to the ventilation grate when your foot finds a section of deck plating that's come loose from its moorings.
CLANG
The metal plate shifts and bangs against its housing. The sound echoes through Engineering like a bell.
The breathing in the maintenance shaft stops instantly. Complete silence for three heartbeats. Then, a panicked scrambling sound - someone moving fast through the confined space, heading AWAY from you, deeper into the shaft system. You hear a muffled sob of terror and the continued frantic whisper, now faster, more desperate:
"Seven-three-five-five-seven-three-five-five-please-no-please-seven-three-five-five-"
They're moving toward the lower access panel - the one in the storage bay. If they exit there, they'll be right where you need to go for the Plasma Injector.
You could:

Race to the ladder and try to get down there first
Call out to identify yourself as friendly
Use the maintenance panel on this level to pursue through the shaft
Let them go and wait for them to clear the area

The medical scanner is still in your hand, unused. Whatever's in that shaft is terrified of you.
What does Dax do?

player: chase after them and attempt to get them to quiet down and recognise me as a 

claude: You sprint toward the ladder well, your four legs carrying you with Vexian speed. The panicked scrambling in the shaft is heading the same direction - down toward the storage bay.
"Wait!" you call out, trying to keep your voice calm and non-threatening. "I'm not going to hurt you! I'm Dax - I'm crew! Technical specialist!"
The scrambling doesn't stop. If anything, it gets more frantic. You reach the ladder and start descending quickly, trying to match their pace through the shaft.
"Listen to me!" you continue, your voice echoing in the ladder well. "I know about Rostova! I found her in the Central Hub - she gave me that code! Seven-three-five-five! I know about the armory!"
Roll a Persuasion check (d20 + your Charisma modifier of 0) to see if you can break through their panic and get them to recognize you as friendly.
As you're climbing down, you can hear them getting closer to the lower access panel. The storage bay is only seconds away for both of you.
What do you roll?

player: Persuasion check: 17 (rolled 

claude: Persuasion check: 17 (Success!)
The scrambling in the shaft suddenly stops. You hear ragged breathing, then a choked voice - female, young, terrified but trying to focus:
"R-Rostova? You... you found Rostova? Is she...?"
"She didn't make it," you say gently, still descending the ladder. "But she left her service number. She wanted someone to get to the armory. I'm here to help."
There's a long pause. Then the access panel below slowly, cautiously, creaks open. You reach the bottom of the ladder just as a figure tumbles out of the maintenance shaft onto the storage bay floor.
She's human, early twenties, wearing a torn engineering jumpsuit with the name "CHEN" on the patch. Her face is pale, streaked with grime and tears, and there's dried blood on her temple. She's clutching her left arm to her chest - it hangs at an wrong angle. She looks up at you with wide, terrified eyes that slowly focus on your Vexian features, then your uniform.
"You're... you're real," Chen whispers. "You're not one of those things. Oh god, I thought... I've been hiding for... I don't know how long. The things in the vents, they killed Martinez, they killed everyone, I saw them pull Martinez up into the—"
She's starting to hyperventilate, edging toward panic again.
You're in the storage bay now. The Plasma Injector cabinet is visible across the room. Chen needs medical attention, but she also might know crucial information about what happened here.
What does Dax do?

player: dax remembers he picked up an array of items from the med bay. he scans chen and does his best to render medical aid, though he's better at fixing machines than people. he tries to get info from her chatting as they 

claude: You kneel beside Chen, pulling out your medical scanner with one hand while rifling through your supplies with the others. "I'm going to help you," you say calmly. "I've got medical supplies. Just keep talking to me - tell me what happened while I work."
You activate the scanner, its blue light washing over Chen as she flinches instinctively.
Scanner readout:

Dislocated left shoulder
Mild concussion
Dehydration
Elevated stress hormones
No biological contamination detected

"This is going to hurt," you warn, pulling out one of your Synth-Flesh applicators. "But I need to reset your shoulder first."
"Wait, wait—" Chen gasps, but you've already positioned your four hands - two to hold her steady, two to manipulate the joint.
Roll a Medicine check (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to see how well you handle the medical treatment. Or if you'd prefer, you could use Intelligence instead, approaching it like an engineering problem.
While you prepare, Chen starts talking through gritted teeth: "Three days ago... maybe four? The Captain brought something aboard from a derelict we found. Said it was... was valuable salvage. But the container breached in the cargo bay. These things... they got Ramirez first. Then they spread through the vents."
She shudders. "Martinez and I sealed ourselves in here, but they found us. Pulled him right up into the vent. I've been hiding in the maintenance shaft since, drinking condensation, trying not to make a sound. There's... there's more than one. At least three, maybe more."
What do you roll for the medical treatment?

player: I rolled 11 on a d20, +1 so 

claude: Medicine check: 12 (Partial Success)
You grip Chen's shoulder, approaching it like a mechanical joint that needs realigning. "On three," you say. "One, two—"
You pull and rotate on two. The shoulder pops back into place with an audible crack. Chen screams, then slumps forward, gasping.
"You said three!" she wheezes.
"Works better when you're not tensed," you reply, already applying the Synth-Flesh applicator around her shoulder. The device hisses as it sprays a layer of artificial skin that hardens into a supportive mesh. It's not pretty - you've applied it a bit thick in some spots, thin in others - but it'll hold.
Chen flexes her fingers experimentally. "It... it works. Thanks."
As you tend to her head wound with your second Synth-Flesh applicator (you're now out), she continues:
"The things... Skitterers, Martinez called them. They hunt by sound. But there's something else too. Something bigger. I heard it once, moving through the main corridors. Heavy. Wet. The Skitterers went quiet when it passed."
She points toward the Plasma Injector cabinet. "That's what you're here for, right? To fix the reactor? Martinez and I tried to get to it, but..." she shudders. "The vents in here aren't webbed, but they're not sealed either. Every time we made noise, we heard clicking from above."
Sure enough, looking up, you see the storage bay's ceiling vents are clear of webbing but dark and open. The room has been quiet so far, but Chen's scream when you reset her shoulder was loud.
Chen struggles to her feet. "We should hurry."
What does Dax do?

player: dex asks chen if she can move, and what she has on her. similarly he shares what he has, and what he's experienced so far fighting one of the creatures.
he tells her of the two options they have - get the ship running and fly, or get into escape pods and ditch. knowing there's more monsters out there, dax wants to leave yesterday. but having found a survivor, he's worried about abandoning any others who might be out 

claude: Chen tests her shoulder, wincing but nodding. "I can move. Hurts like hell, but I'll manage." She pats her pockets, pulling out a few items:
"I've got a plasma torch from my engineering kit - almost dead though, maybe thirty seconds of charge left. A half-empty water bottle. And..." she produces a small data pad, "Martinez's personal log. He was tracking the creatures' movements before... before they got him."
You share your inventory with her: the sidearm (10 rounds), the cryo-foam canister, multi-tool, and dead datapad you turned into a bomb earlier. You quickly explain your encounter with the Skitterer - the fire vulnerability, how sound attracts them, the way you trapped one in the maintenance closet.
Chen's eyes widen. "You fought one alone? And survived?" She looks at you with new respect. "Martinez was military, and even he..." she trails off.
You explain the two options - fix the reactor or escape pods. Chen listens, then shakes her head.
"There are others," she says firmly. "Or there were. Dr. Yuen was alive two days ago - I heard her on the intercom trying to coordinate survivors. She mentioned gathering people in the Medical Bay, but the comms cut out. And..." she hesitates, "there's something else. Martinez suspected the Captain might still be alive on the Bridge. Sealed himself in when everything went to hell."
She looks at the Plasma Injector cabinet, then back at you. "If we fix the reactor, we get main power back. That means internal sensors, proper lighting, maybe even internal defenses. We could find other survivors easier. But if we run for the pods..." she swallows hard, "we might be leaving people to die."
The weight of command decision sits heavy. Chen adds quietly, "Whatever you decide, I'm with you. You saved my life. But Martinez kept saying - 'no one left behind.' He died believing that."
From somewhere above, very faint, you both hear a familiar sound: click... click... click...
The Skitterers know you're here.
What does Dax do?

player: fuck. FUCK. dax can't bring himself to consider the escape pods any more. at least not until they can get everyone on them. he has to keep the potential of freezing the entire ship in the back of his mind, in case things turn ugly.
dax tells chen the med scanner said she was dehydrated - encourages her to take a drink. then goes for the plasma 

claude: The moral weight settles on your shoulders. You're not leaving anyone behind if you can help it.
"Take a drink," you tell Chen firmly, gesturing to her water bottle. "Doctor's orders. Or, well, tech-scout with a medical scanner's orders."
She takes a few careful sips while you move toward the Plasma Injector cabinet. It's a standard industrial storage unit with a heavy magnetic lock - fortunately, it's on the emergency power circuit and still functional. Your multi-tool should be able to bypass it.
The clicking from above gets slightly louder. Multiple sources now - at least two, maybe three Skitterers tracking your position through the vents.
The cabinet is 5 meters away. Chen stays close behind you, her breathing controlled but tense. As you approach, you notice the floor around the cabinet has scratch marks - deep gouges in the metal, like something with claws tried to force it open but failed.
Your multi-tool has a plasma torch (for cutting), a sonic wrench (for loosening bolts), and a wire bypass tool (for electronic locks). The cabinet's lock is electronic with a manual override.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + your Intelligence modifier of +3) to efficiently bypass the lock before the Skitterers decide to drop through those vents.
The clicking is now directly overhead. Chen grips her nearly-dead plasma torch, ready to defend if needed.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 11 on a d20 +3, 

claude: Intelligence (Technology) check: 14 (Success!)
Your multi-tool's wire bypass clicks into the lock's access port. The cabinet's security is decent, but standard - you've worked with these systems before. Your fingers dance across the bypass tool's interface, rerouting power through the emergency circuit to trick the lock into thinking it received the proper authorization code.
Click-THUNK.
The magnetic seal disengages. The cabinet door swings open revealing the prize: a pristine Plasma Injector, still in its protective case. It's about the size of your forearm, a cylinder of reinforced glass containing a swirling, blue-white plasma core. Next to it sits a maintenance manual and a secondary stabilizer unit.
"Got it!" you whisper, carefully lifting the injector.
At that exact moment, a wet tearing sound comes from above. One of the vent grates is being pried open from inside. Black, viscous webbing begins to drip through the widening gap.
"Move!" Chen hisses, backing toward the ladder.
You have the Plasma Injector, but now you need to:

Get back up the ladder to Engineering (where you can install it)
Avoid or fight the Skitterers that are literally breaking through above you
Keep the fragile injector intact

The closest vent is about 4 meters away. The ladder is 10 meters. More tearing sounds indicate multiple vents are being compromised.
Chen raises her nearly-dead plasma torch. "Thirty seconds of charge. Your call - fight or run?"
What does Dax do?

player: dax tells her we can't fight. she said herself, soldiers can't even beat them. we just have to outsmart them.
he takes the busted datapad and jagged metal and prepares to rig up another makeshift grenade. he tells chen to get ready to run for the ladder and race up it. the timing has to be just right to buy enough for them to get to the top of the ladder and seal it back 

claude: You pull out the dead datapad and jagged metal shard, your hands already working on the familiar improvisation. "We run," you tell Chen firmly. "But we need a distraction first."
Chen nods, understanding immediately. "I'll cover the ladder. Go!"
Above, a Skitterer's eyeless head pushes through the vent, antennae twitching. Then another vent tears open 3 meters to your left.
You need to puncture the datapad's battery at just the right angle to create maximum thermal discharge - you've done this once before, but under pressure with multiple threats, it'll be harder.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to successfully create another thermal grenade quickly enough.
The first Skitterer drops to the floor with a wet thud, its blade-like forelimbs clicking against the deck. It's between you and the ladder now, head swiveling as it tastes the air.
Chen backs toward the ladder, keeping her plasma torch ready but not ignited yet - saving those precious thirty seconds.
"Whatever you're doing, do it fast!" she hisses.
The second Skitterer is squeezing through its vent. You've got seconds.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 14 on a d20 +3 for 

claude: Intelligence (Technology) check: 17 (Success!)
Your hands work with practiced precision despite the chaos. You've done this once - you can do it again. The metal shard punches through the datapad's casing at the perfect angle, right into the battery's sweet spot.
The device immediately starts whining, heating up fast.
"NOW!" you shout, hurling the improvised grenade between the first Skitterer and the ladder.
The datapad detonates in mid-air with a brilliant flash and a wave of searing heat. The Skitterer shrieks, reeling back from the thermal blast, its sensitive antennae overwhelmed.
"GO GO GO!"
Chen doesn't need to be told twice. She sprints for the ladder as the second Skitterer drops from the ceiling behind you. You clutch the Plasma Injector case to your chest and bolt after her, your four legs pumping.
Chen hits the ladder first, climbing with desperate speed. You're right behind her, using your multiple arms to climb faster than any human could. Below, the first Skitterer recovers, letting out an enraged shriek. You hear its claws scraping against the ladder's metal as it starts pursuing.
"The hatch!" Chen gasps, hauling herself up onto the Engineering deck. "There's an emergency seal!"
You scramble up, the Plasma Injector secure in one arm. Below, the Skitterer is climbing fast, maybe 3 meters down and closing.
Roll a Strength check (d20 + your -1 modifier) to help Chen slam the emergency hatch seal before the Skitterer reaches you!
The creature's blade-arms are reaching up through the ladder well...
What do you roll?

player: shit, I rolled 10 on a d20, -1 for 

claude: Strength check: 9 (Failure!)
You and Chen both grab the heavy emergency hatch, pulling with everything you have. But it's rusted, stuck from years of disuse. The metal groans but doesn't budge fast enough.
A bladed arm shoots up through the gap, missing your leg by inches! The Skitterer's head appears at the rim, mandibles clicking furiously.
"The torch!" you shout.
Chen doesn't hesitate. She ignites her plasma torch and jams it right into the creature's face. The thirty seconds of charge she mentioned goes fast - but it's enough. The brilliant blue-white flame sears into the Skitterer's head, and it shrieks, losing its grip and tumbling back down the ladder well with a heavy crash.
The torch sputters and dies just as you both finally wrench the hatch closed, spinning the manual lock wheel.
THUNK.
You can hear angry clicking and scraping from below, but the hatch is sealed.
Chen collapses against the floor, breathing hard. "That's it. Torch is completely dead now." She looks at the Plasma Injector case in your arms. "Please tell me that thing's intact."
You check - the case protected it perfectly. The injector is undamaged.
You're back in Engineering, main deck. The reactor core looms above. The console where you need to install the injector is 20 meters away. But now you have what you need to save the ship.
Chen struggles to her feet. "What now, boss?"
What does Dax do?

player: "now? now we make sure everything we do is as quiet as possible. between us we've escaped death three times now. i dunno how many lives you humans have, but vexians don't even have *this *many"
dax sneaks over to the consoles to get the plasma injector installed and running, though in a mode that runs silently at first - no sudden power-ups or the 

claude: Chen nods grimly. "Nine lives is just a saying. Pretty sure I've used most of mine today."
You both move in near-silence across Engineering, every footstep calculated. The massive reactor core hums its low, dormant song. At the main console, you carefully open the Plasma Injector case and examine the installation panel.
The reactor's injection port is accessible through a maintenance panel beneath the console. You'll need to:

Remove the shattered old injector
Install the new one
Manually restart the coolant loop
Bring the reactor online in staged increments to avoid power surges

Chen watches your back, eyes scanning the webbed vents above. "How long will this take?"
You assess the setup. "Ten minutes if nothing goes wrong. Maybe fifteen for a truly silent startup sequence."
The broken injector is a mess - crystallized plasma residue everywhere. You'll need to clean the housing before installing the new one. Your multi-tool should handle it, but working in near-darkness by console light will require precision.
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to perform the delicate installation and calibration without triggering any alarms or power surges that might attract attention.
Chen whispers, "The vents have gone quiet. That's... probably not good."
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 17 on a d20 +3 for a 

claude: Intelligence (Technology) check: 20 (Critical Success!)
Your four hands move like a symphony of precision. This isn't just repair work - it's art.
You extract the shattered injector with delicate care, each crystallized fragment removed without a single clink. The housing is scored and carbonized, but your multi-tool's plasma torch - set to its lowest, quietest setting - cleans it perfectly.
Chen watches in amazement as you install the new Plasma Injector with movements so smooth it barely makes a whisper. The cylinder slides home with a soft, satisfying click.
Now for the masterwork: You access the reactor's startup subroutines and begin rewriting them on the fly. Instead of the standard emergency restart (loud, bright, sudden), you program a cascading slow-initialization sequence. Each system will come online individually, power ramping up in increments so gradual that the ship's acoustics won't even change.
"You're... you're programming a stealth restart," Chen whispers in awe. "I didn't even know that was possible."
The coolant loop begins cycling - not with its usual rushing whoosh, but with a gentle, barely audible flow. The reactor core's surface begins to glow, but so faintly it's like watching a sunset in extreme slow motion.
Stage 1 complete: Emergency power boosted by 15%
Stage 2 complete: Life support optimal
Stage 3 complete: Internal sensors coming online...
The console flickers with new data. You now have access to motion sensors throughout the ship. The results are... sobering:

3 Skitterers in Engineering vents (dormant)
2 Skitterers in Central Hub (active, moving)
1 unknown large biosignature in Cargo Bay
4 human life signs detected: You, Chen, one in Medical Bay (weak), one on the Bridge (stable)

Chen sees the readout. "Dr. Yuen made it to Medical. And the Captain's alive!"
Stage 4 initiating: Main power at 40% and rising slowly...
The ship is coming back to life under your hands, silent as a whisper.
What's the plan, Dax?

player: dax tells chen about the medbay... how he'd come from there... how there's an angry skitterer trapped between a hall of fire and... the room where dr. yuen is... dax doesn't think they have enough to get to the doctor and back, not without ruining any chance of moving forward to the 

claude: Chen's face falls as you explain the situation. The Medical Bay is cut off by fire on one side and a trapped, enraged Skitterer on the other.
"Dr. Yuen's trapped," Chen says quietly. "The sensors show she's weak. She might be injured, running out of supplies..." She runs a hand through her hair. "But you're right. We don't have the firepower to fight through multiple Skitterers. Not with 10 rounds and a cryo-foam canister."
She looks at the sensor display showing the Bridge. "The Captain has the escape pod controls. If we can reach him, we could launch a ship-wide evacuation alert, get everyone to the pods. But that means leaving Dr. Yuen alone even longer."
The reactor continues its silent climb. Stage 5 complete: Main power at 55%.
Chen studies the ship schematic. "Wait. With main power coming back, we might have options. The fire suppression systems should come online soon. We could vent the burning corridor to space if we reach the right controls. Or..." she points to a route, "there's an environmental control station one deck up. We could flood that entire section with halon gas - kills the fire, but also knocks out anyone without a mask."
The motion sensors flicker: the two Skitterers in the Central Hub are moving toward the Engineering door. They're investigating the subtle power changes.
"We need to decide fast," Chen whispers. "Dr. Yuen alone in Medical, or the Captain on the Bridge. Who do we save first?"
The weight of the decision hangs heavy. Both survivors need help. Time is running out.
What does Dax do?

player: dax thinks back to his time in the medbay. the door to the corridor was left open, as was the vent that led to the central hub maintenance closet. he asks chen, "spacing it would mean losing the doctor to the void, no?"
either way, it's the central hub that needs immediate attention. they'll not get far with the two creatures right outside the door. but the hub... the hub *is *sealed shut. 
dax asks chen to help him find a way to space the central 

claude: You think through the geometry of the ship. The Medical Bay door was indeed left open to the burning corridor, and that maintenance tunnel you escaped through... it leads right back to the Central Hub. Spacing the Hub would create a vacuum that would pull through those connections.
Chen's eyes widen as she realizes the same thing. "Oh god, you're right. The pressure differential would suck everything through those openings. Dr. Yuen wouldn't stand a chance."
She pounds her fist against the console in frustration, then forces herself to think. "Okay, okay. The Hub is sealed from this side, you're right. But those two Skitterers..." She pulls up the environmental controls on the console. "Wait. Look at this."
The schematic shows the Central Hub's atmospheric systems. "The Hub has emergency vent hatches in the ceiling - for exactly this scenario. But they're manually operated from inside the Hub itself, or..." she traces a pathway, "from the Bridge override controls."
The motion sensors ping: the two Skitterers in the Hub have settled near the Engineering door, seemingly waiting.
"There's one other option," Chen says quietly. "The Hub has an observation window looking out into space. Port side, reinforced transparisteel. If we could somehow break it..."
She looks at you. "Your cryo-foam. If we could get it on that window, the thermal shock might crack it. But we'd need to be in the Hub to do it, with those things."
Stage 6 complete: Main power at 70%. Internal comms system now available.
A new option appears on your console: ship-wide intercom.
What does Dax do?

player: dax tries not to panic. he recalls how important the cold is in fighting these things, reluctant to use such a useful close-combat defensive tool to blow a hole in the ship.
all the answers are in the bridge. (pause - does dax know how to get from engineering to the bridge? i 

claude: Yes! Earlier when you checked the terminal in the Central Hub, you mapped the route to the Bridge. From the Gemini logs:
The path to the Bridge from Engineering:

Exit Engineering into the Central Hub (currently blocked by 2 Skitterers)
From the Hub, take the main lift up two decks
Go through the Officer's Quarters corridor
Finally reach the Bridge

So you'd need to somehow get through or around those two Skitterers in the Hub first. The Bridge feels both tantalizingly close and impossibly far away.

You stare at the console, mind racing. The cryo-foam is too valuable to waste on breaking a window. Those creatures are vulnerable to cold - it might be your only real weapon against them.
"The Bridge has all the answers," you mutter. "Pod controls, environmental overrides, maybe even weapons systems."
Chen nods. "But those two Skitterers are literally camping our only door out."
The ship's intercom system glows ready on the console. You could try to contact the Captain or Dr. Yuen. You could also potentially use sound to lure the Skitterers somewhere else.
Stage 7 complete: Main power at 85%.
A new alert appears: "FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS: ONLINE - AWAITING COMMAND"
The system could suppress the fire in Corridor Gamma-7, but it would take 10 minutes to fully extinguish, and you'd still have the trapped Skitterer to deal with.
What does Dax do?

player: dax pulls himself together. he lays out the plan for chen.
he asks her to hit the ship-wide intercom and shout, as loud as she can, "THEY CAN'T SEE - DON'T MAKE A SOUND".
at the same time, dax uses the distraction to attempt to open the engineering bay door as quietly as possible. and then they both bolt for the 

claude: You take a deep breath, centering yourself. The plan is risky but solid.
"Alright. When you hit that intercom, those things are going to focus on the nearest sound source - you. Then I open the door and we run like hell."
Chen positions herself at the intercom, finger hovering over the broadcast button. "The lift is about 30 meters from the Engineering door. We'll have maybe five seconds before they recover from the surprise."
You move to the door controls, hand ready. The motion sensors show both Skitterers still lurking just outside.
"On three," you whisper. "One... two..."
"THREE!"
Chen slams the intercom button and bellows: "THEY CAN'T SEE - DON'T MAKE A SOUND!"
Her amplified voice echoes through the entire ship. On the sensors, you see both Skitterers immediately orient toward the nearest intercom speaker - on the far wall of the Hub.
Now!
Roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check (d20 + 4) to see if you can get the door open quietly while they're distracted.
The door mechanism is heavy and hasn't been maintained recently. This is the critical moment - if they hear it opening, you'll be fighting two Skitterers head-on with nowhere to run.
What do you roll?

player: Stealth check: 12 (rolled 

claude: Stealth check: 12 (Partial Success)
The door mechanism groans softly as you ease it open. One of the Skitterers' head snaps toward you, antennae twitching, but Chen's amplified voice is still echoing through the Hub's speakers, creating acoustic chaos.
"RUN!" you hiss.
You and Chen burst through the door into the Central Hub. The vast chamber is dimly lit by emergency power and the ghostly flicker of the holographic star map. The two Skitterers are about 15 meters away, near the far wall, but they're already turning toward you.
You sprint for the lift, Chen right beside you. Your multiple legs give you an advantage in speed, but she's running on pure adrenaline.
The lift doors are closed. You slam into the call button. The ancient mechanism begins to respond, doors starting to part with agonizing slowness.
Behind you, the distinctive click-clack-click of Skitterer legs on metal accelerates. They're charging.
"COME ON!" Chen shouts at the lift.
The doors are halfway open. You can squeeze through, but it's tight.
Roll a Dexterity saving throw (d20 + 4) to see if you both can dive through the closing lift doors before the Skitterers reach you!
The nearest Skitterer is raising its blade-arms, maybe 5 meters away and closing fast...
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 15 on a d20 +4 for 

claude: Dexterity saving throw: 19 (Success!)
You grab Chen with two arms while your other two push off the doorframe, launching both of you through the gap. You hit the lift floor hard, rolling as the doors continue their leisurely close.
A blade-arm slashes through the narrowing gap, missing Chen's leg by centimeters. The Skitterer slams into the doors, wedging its head partially through, mandibles snapping viciously.
Chen kicks it square in the face with her boot. "GET! BACK!"
The creature reels back just as the doors seal shut with a definitive clang.
You're both panting on the lift floor. Safe. For now.
"Deck... seven," Chen gasps, hitting the button for the Bridge level. "Officer's quarters... then Bridge."
The lift shudders and begins to rise. Through the thin walls, you can hear the frustrated shrieks of the Skitterers below, and the angry banging as they attack the lift doors.
Chen pulls herself up using the wall. "That was insane. But it worked. Your message was perfect - now the Captain and Dr. Yuen know the creatures hunt by sound."
The lift indicator shows: Deck 3... Deck 4... Deck 5...
"Dax," Chen says quietly. "The motion sensors showed something big in the Cargo Bay. Bigger than the Skitterers. What if it's between us and the Bridge?"
Deck 6... Deck 7.
DING
The doors begin to open onto the Officer's Quarters corridor. It's dark, lit only by emergency strips along the floor. The hallway stretches ahead, multiple doors on either side, leading toward a reinforced bulkhead marked "BRIDGE - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY."
The corridor appears empty. Too empty. No debris, no signs of struggle. Just pristine, waiting darkness.
What does Dax do?

player: dax's eyes glaze over, thinking about the doctor they've left so many floors down with those creatures. his failures left them wide open access to her from all angles.
"we have to save her"
dax bolts for the door and looks for a way to hack inside, or at least to communicate with the 

claude: The guilt hits you like a physical weight. Dr. Yuen is trapped, weak, possibly dying, and your escape route left her exposed to the creatures from multiple angles.
"We have to save her," you repeat, sprinting toward the Bridge bulkhead.
Chen runs after you. "Dax, wait—"
The Bridge door is massive, reinforced, with both electronic and manual locks. A security panel beside it glows amber - locked down. There's also an intercom grille specifically for Bridge communication.
You slam your palm on the intercom button. "Captain! This is Technical Specialist Dax Stargazer with Engineer Chen. We've restored main power. We need Bridge access NOW. Dr. Yuen is trapped in Medical with hostiles converging on her position!"
Silence.
Then, a ragged male voice crackles through: "...Stargazer? You're alive? Thank god. I'm Captain Morrison. I've... I've been monitoring the situation. The doctor's bio-signs are weakening."
"Then open this door!" you shout, already pulling out your multi-tool to attack the lock mechanism.
"I can't," Morrison's voice cracks. "Not yet. Listen to me very carefully. I'm injured. Badly. I sealed myself in here three days ago when those things overran the command deck. I've been using the last of my strength to maintain quarantine protocols, but..."
A pause. Heavy breathing.
"The cargo bay creature. It's not like the others. It's... it's growing. The sensors show it's tripled in size. If I open any bulkheads now, including this one, it could trigger the automated pathway systems. That thing could reach any part of the ship in minutes."
Chen grabs your arm. "Dax, he's right. If that thing is mobile—"
"I DON'T CARE!" You're already working on the panel, trying to find a bypass. "We're not leaving her to die!"
Roll an Intelligence (Technology) check (d20 + 3) to attempt to override the Bridge locks without triggering the automated systems Morrison warned about.
What do you roll?

player: I rolled 8 on a d20, +3 for 

claude: Intelligence (Technology) check: 11 (Partial Success)
Your multi-tool sparks against the panel's inner workings. You're making progress, but these Bridge security protocols are military-grade. Sweat beads on your forehead as you work.
"Almost... almost..." You manage to bypass the first two security layers, but the third is encrypted with Captain-level authorization codes.
Morrison's voice crackles through: "Stargazer, stop! You're triggering proximity alerts. The cargo bay... oh god, it's moving. It knows someone's trying to breach secure areas."
On a small emergency display next to the door, you see a ship schematic light up. A massive red dot begins moving from the Cargo Bay, heading toward the lift shaft.
"It's climbing," Morrison whispers. "The thing is CLIMBING the lift shaft. It'll reach Deck 7 in minutes."
Chen pulls you back from the panel. "Dax, we need weapons or we need to run. NOW."
Morrison speaks again, faster now: "Listen! My override code is Zulu-Seven-Seven-Alpha-Nine. But if I open this door now, the automated systems will create a direct path from the lift to the Bridge. That thing will follow. You need to make a choice - get in here and seal yourselves with me, or lead it away from both Dr. Yuen and the Bridge."
From down the corridor behind you, you hear the lift shaft doors buckle. Something immense is forcing them apart from inside.
The Captain adds desperately: "There's an emergency weapons locker in Officer Quarters 3, halfway down the hall. Code is 7-3-5-5 - Rostova's code!"
A wet, tearing sound echoes from the lift. Something is squeezing through.
What does Dax do?

player: dax slams the door with all four fists in frustration. he forgets rank and process and demands that the captain do whatever he can to lockdown the medbay.
dax and chen use rostova's code to get into the officer quarters and look around primarily for anything that makes a lot of light or cold, and then for anything ballistic that might make a tremendous 

claude: The BANG of your four fists against reinforced steel echoes down the corridor.
"Captain, LOCK DOWN THE MEDICAL BAY NOW!" you roar, abandoning all protocol. "Whatever systems you have left - seal it!"
"I... I'm trying!" Morrison's voice crackles back. "Emergency bulkheads engaging... Medical Bay sealed. But Stargazer, her oxygen is limited now—"
You're already sprinting with Chen toward Officer Quarters 3. Behind you, something massive and wet slithers out of the lift shaft with a sound like meat being pulled apart.
Chen reaches the door first, punching in 7-3-5-5. The lock chirps green and you both pile inside.
The officer's quarters have been converted into an emergency armory. Rostova was prepared. Your eyes scan rapidly for anything useful:
COLD/LIGHT OPTIONS:

Emergency flare gun (6 magnesium flares - 2000°C burning temperature, blinding light)
Portable work lights (battery powered, extremely bright but not weaponized)
No additional cryo weapons

BALLISTIC/NOISE:

Riot shotgun (8 shells - thunderous noise, wide spread)
Two flashbang grenades (deafening blast, disorienting strobe)
Standard sidearm ammunition (30 rounds, fits your pistol)

Chen grabs the shotgun immediately. "This'll wake up the whole ship."
From the corridor, you hear a wet dragging sound getting closer. Whatever came from the cargo bay doesn't move like a Skitterer - it's massive, heavy, deliberate.
The Captain's voice crackles over the room's intercom: "Motion sensors show... oh god, it's huge. Twenty meters from your position and closing."
You have seconds to grab what you need and decide: Face this thing, or find another route?
What does Dax do?

player: dax grabs the flare gun but refocuses - he wants to lure this thing into the room they're in and set it all off. it might blow a hole into space, but as long as the door holds, he doesn't care. after picking the one item, he looks around for another way out of this room. he tells chen to plan to blow the 

claude: You grab the flare gun, already calculating the destruction it could cause in this confined space full of munitions. Chen's eyes widen as she understands your plan.
"You're insane," she breathes, but she's already grabbing flashbangs.
You scan the quarters desperately. Officer accommodations are usually connected - there! A maintenance hatch in the ceiling, probably leading to the environmental systems between decks.
The wet dragging is right outside the door now. The metal actually groans under something's weight.
"Chen, up!" You boost her toward the hatch with two arms while prying at it with the others. It's stuck, painted over—
The door to the quarters begins to buckle inward. Not breaking, but melting, the metal running like wax. Through the widening gaps, you see something that makes your brain rebel.
It WAS human once. Maybe. Now it's a writhing mass of flesh and absorbed materials - bits of metal, fabric, and other organic matter all fused into a nightmare roughly three meters tall. Eyes, dozens of them, blink randomly across its surface. A mouth opens where no mouth should be.
"THE COLD MAKES IT SLOW BUT IT DOESN'T STOP IT," Morrison screams over the intercom. "ROSTOVA'S LAST NOTES - IT'S STILL SPREADING, STILL GROWING—"
The maintenance hatch finally gives way. Chen hauls herself up.
Roll a Dexterity check (d20 + 4) to grab what you need and get through the hatch before this abomination enters the room!
What do you roll?

player: hell yeah, I rolled 18 on a d20 +4 for 

claude: Dexterity check: 22 (Critical Success!)
You move like liquid lightning. In one fluid motion, you grab two more flashbangs from the rack, toss them to arm strategically around the room, and leap upward. Your multiple arms make you a natural climber - you're through the hatch in seconds.
Just as you pull your legs up, the thing surges into the room below, its bulk filling the doorway. It "looks" up with those dozens of eyes, a wet gurgling sound emanating from multiple mouths.
"NOW!" you shout.
Chen doesn't hesitate. She pulls the pins on her flashbangs and drops them through the hatch. You add the flare gun's payload - all six flares fired in rapid succession down into that ammunition-filled room.
You both scramble through the crawlspace as fast as possible. Behind you:
BANG-BANG-BANG! The flashbangs detonate.
Then the flares hit the ammunition.
The explosion is catastrophic. The entire deck shudders. A wave of heat and pressure chases you through the crawlspace, but the reinforced structure holds. You hear shrieking metal, a terrible organic screaming, and then—
Sudden decompression. The blast must have breached the hull. Emergency klaxons wail as bulkheads automatically seal.
Morrison's voice, frantic: "Hull breach, Deck 7, Section C! Emergency containment... successful. The... the creature's bio-signature is gone. It's been spaced."
You and Chen drop through another hatch into a different corridor - you're past the sealed section, closer to the Bridge.
Chen is shaking. "We... we just blew a hole in the ship."
"But we're alive," you pant. "And that thing is gone."
The Bridge door is just ahead now, and Morrison is already entering his override code from the inside.
What does Dax do?

player: (holy shit, nice one.) dax is pleased they got rid of that thing, but laments not having been able to scan it. the information would have been very useful, in the immediate and for whenever they get out of this hell. when... they do...
"the doctor"
dax hurries towards the 

claude: The Bridge door hisses open, revealing a command center bathed in emergency lighting. Captain Morrison is slumped in the command chair, his uniform soaked with blood from a deep gash across his torso. His face is pale, drawn, but his eyes are sharp with determination.
"Stargazer, Chen," he rasps. "You did it. That... abomination is gone."
You rush forward but your mind is already elsewhere. "The doctor. We need to get to Dr. Yuen NOW."
Morrison weakly gestures to the main console. "Life support shows she's still alive, but barely. The Medical Bay is sealed, limited oxygen. Maybe... thirty minutes left." He coughs, blood speckling his lips. "The fire in Gamma-7 is dying down. Fire suppression finally kicked in. But those Skitterers..."
Chen is already at the weapons locker, loading fresh shells into the shotgun. "How many between us and Medical?"
Morrison pulls up the sensor display with a shaking hand. "Two in the Central Hub still. One trapped in the maintenance closet - that's your doing, Stargazer? And... three dormant in the Engineering vents."
You check your supplies: flare gun (empty), your sidearm (10 rounds), the cryo-foam canister (unused), multi-tool. Chen has the shotgun (8 shells) and the extra ammunition.
"The escape pods," Morrison continues weakly. "I can prep them for launch from here. But I can't leave this chair. Internal bleeding. I'm not... I'm not going to make it off this ship."
Chen looks stricken. "Captain, no—"
"That's an order, Engineer." His voice gains strength. "Save Dr. Yuen. Get to the pods. I'll keep the systems running as long as I can."
The timer is ticking. Dr. Yuen has less than 30 minutes of air.
What does Dax do?

player: dax wants to save them all. he does. but he caused the doctor's peril she's in. he knows he'll never sleep sound again unless he rights that wrong. it's almost strange how focused he is on her... as if something's tugging on his lost memories...
dax gives chen the medical scanner and asks if there's anything they can do for him, even... just temporarily...
meanwhile dax plans a route to the escape pods via the medbay. the lift they came in must be beyond repair, and the corridor leading to it is spaced (right? the emergency lockdown wouldn't have helped the melted door to the officers quarters?). they'll need another way 

claude: Chen takes the medical scanner and runs it over Morrison. The device confirms what you already suspected - massive internal hemorrhaging, multiple organ failure. He has maybe an hour at best.
"Captain," Chen says softly. "We could use the synth-flesh applicators, but—"
"Save them for someone who needs them," Morrison cuts her off. "I knew what I was doing when I stayed. Someone had to keep the quarantine protocols active." He manages a weak smile. "Besides, this chair has the best view in the ship."
You force yourself to focus on the route. The corridor you came through is definitely compromised - that explosion tore through Officer Quarters 3 and likely destroyed the lift shaft. You scan the Bridge's emergency schematics.
"There," you point. "Emergency access shaft behind the Bridge. It goes straight down to Deck 4, comes out near secondary cargo. From there, we can cut through to reach the Medical Bay's back entrance - the one that leads to the emergency ward."
Morrison nods. "Smart. That route bypasses the Central Hub entirely. But..." he pulls up more sensors, "you'll pass right by the main cargo hold. Where that thing came from. There might be... residue. Or worse."
Chen loads her shotgun. "Twenty-five minutes of air left for Dr. Yuen."
Something tugs at your mind when you think of her. A flash of... something. A memory just out of reach. White coat. Gentle hands checking the strange energy signature behind your temple. A soft voice saying, "Don't worry, Dax. You're going to be fine. I promise."
You shake your head. Focus.
Morrison starts typing commands. "I'm opening the emergency shaft and plotting your route. The escape pods will be primed and ready. Bay 3 is closest to Medical - I'll make sure it stays clear."
The captain looks at you both. "Whatever happens, don't come back for me. That's an order."
Behind the main command console, a panel slides open revealing a narrow vertical shaft with ladder rungs.
What does Dax do?

player: dax takes an awkward moment to apologize... a weak salute, a thank you... and heads for the 

claude: You turn to Morrison and offer an awkward, four-armed salute - not quite military regulation, but heartfelt. "Thank you, Captain. For... for holding the line."
Morrison returns it weakly. "Get our people home, Stargazer."
You and Chen descend into the emergency shaft. The rungs are cold under your hands, and you move quickly but carefully in the darkness. Chen follows above you, the shotgun slung across her back.
Deck 6... Deck 5... Deck 4.
The shaft opens into a utility corridor. Immediately, the smell hits you - organic, wrong, like rotting fruit mixed with ozone. The walls here have a thin film of something translucent and sticky.
"Residue," Chen whispers. "From that thing."
You move quickly, trying not to think about what you're walking through. The main cargo hold doors are sealed, but you can see through the reinforced windows - the entire bay is coated in the same organic film, with strange, pod-like growths on the walls. They pulse faintly.
"Keep moving," you mutter, that strange pull toward Medical Bay getting stronger.
Another flash of memory: Dr. Yuen's voice, clearer now. "The energy signature in your temporal lobe, Dax. It's not harmful, but it's... unusual. Like an echo of something. When you're ready, come find me. We'll figure it out together."
Twenty minutes of air left.
You reach the emergency ward entrance. Your scanner (in Chen's hands) shows Dr. Yuen's life signs are weak but stable, located in the main treatment room. The trapped Skitterer is in the maintenance closet about 30 meters away, still contained.
The ward door is sealed but responds to your multi-tool. As it hisses open, stale air rushes out.
What does Dax do?

player: dax tries to joke about not thinking too much about what all that was they just walked through, but the gravity of the situation makes it sound like genuine worry.
he asks chen to help him look around the emergency ward for anything that might help the 

claude: "Let's just... not think about the cargo bay," you attempt weakly, but your voice betrays genuine concern. "Whatever was growing in there..."
Chen gives you a grim look. "Yeah. Let's focus on Dr. Yuen."
The emergency ward is a smaller medical facility, separate from the main Med Bay you woke up in. It's clearly been ransacked - supplies scattered, cabinets torn open. Someone was looking for something desperately.
You and Chen quickly search through the chaos:
Chen finds:

Oxygen mask with a portable 10-minute emergency tank
Two more stim injectors (adrenaline-based)
Surgical laser (battery nearly dead)

You discover:

IV fluid bags (still sealed)
Emergency thermal blanket
A medical log pad, still powered

The log pad's last entry is from Dr. Yuen, dated two days ago:
"Barricaded in Treatment Room 2. The infections are spreading among the survivors I'm treating. Not from wounds - from exposure to the organic matter in the cargo. It changes people. Morrison was right to maintain quarantine. If anyone reads this, DO NOT let the infected reach the escape pods."
Chen's face pales. "Infected survivors? But the sensors only show Dr. Yuen..."
Fifteen minutes of oxygen left.
From deeper in the ward, you hear a faint tapping. Rhythmic. Deliberate. Like someone knocking on glass.
Treatment Room 2 is just ahead, its observation window dark.
What does Dax do?

player: infected... escape pods... the cargo bay...
"scan us" dax says, intentionally trying to ignore the tapping, "and pick up everything you can. i'll do the same. we'll only need it for the doctor, scoop up whatever you can take into the next room. i'll focus on getting us in"
dax begins breaking his way into the main med 

claude: Chen quickly runs the scanner over both of you while you work on the door.
"We're clean," she reports, relief evident in her voice. "No contamination detected." She starts gathering supplies - oxygen tanks, IV bags, anything portable.
You focus on the Med Bay door. It's magnetically sealed from the emergency quarantine. Your multi-tool's plasma torch still has charge, and you start cutting through the lock mechanism.
The tapping from Treatment Room 2 gets more insistent. You don't look. Can't look. Not yet.
The lock gives way with a sharp crack. The door to the main Med Bay hisses open, and you're back where this nightmare started. The cryo-pod you woke from stands open like a mouth. The terminal you first accessed flickers weakly. And there, in the corner near the surgical suite, is Dr. Yuen.
She's alive but unconscious, slumped against the wall. An oxygen mask covers her face, connected to a depleted tank. Her medical coat is stained with blood - not all of it hers. Around her are three bodies, other crew members who didn't make it.
Chen rushes over with the emergency oxygen tank, swapping it quickly. "Ten minutes of air, then we move."
Dr. Yuen's eyes flutter open as the fresh oxygen hits. She focuses on you, and despite everything, manages a weak smile.
"Dax... knew you'd come back. The signature... behind your temple... it's a memory lock. You asked me to... to put it there. Before the mission. You knew something... something about the cargo..."
The tapping from the emergency ward has turned into pounding.
Roll a Medicine check (d20 + 1) to stabilize Dr. Yuen enough to move her to the escape pods.
What do you roll?

player: shit, I rolled 6 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Medicine check: 7 (Failure)
You try to help Dr. Yuen sit up, but she cries out in pain. Your hands come away bloody - there's a deep laceration along her ribs you hadn't seen, poorly bandaged and reopened.
"Stop, stop—" she gasps. "Broken ribs too. From when the ship lurched."
Chen curses. "She can't move like this. We need to properly stabilize her or she'll bleed out before we reach the pods."
The pounding from the emergency ward intensifies. Glass cracks.
Dr. Yuen grabs your arm with surprising strength. "Dax, listen. The memory lock—you were investigating the Captain's cargo manifest. You found discrepancies. The artifacts weren't from a derelict. They were... purchased. Black market. Morrison didn't know what he was buying."
Her eyes are urgent, desperate. "The code is your employee ID backwards. 5-5-3-7. It'll unlock the memories. But Dax, you might not—"
CRASH.
The observation window in the emergency ward shatters. Through the doorway, you see shapes moving. Not Skitterers. People. But wrong. Their movements are jerky, unnatural. The infection Dr. Yuen mentioned.
"We need to move NOW," Chen says, trying to lift Dr. Yuen despite her injuries.
You have to decide:

Try to carry Dr. Yuen despite her injuries (risking further damage)
Stay and defend while properly treating her wounds
The memory unlock code is right there (5-5-3-7)... but is now the time?

Eight minutes of oxygen left.
What does Dax do?

player: dax tells chen to leave the medical equipment with him and fend off the infected as best as she can while he treats the doctor. "whatever you do, do not let them near you. do not get infected. we're getting out of here, all three of 

claude: Chen doesn't hesitate. She chambers a shell in the shotgun. "On it. Just save her!"
She moves to the doorway between the main Med Bay and the emergency ward. The first infected stumbles through - it was once a crew member, still wearing a science division uniform, but fungal growths pulse along their neck and arms. Their eyes are milky, unfocused.
BOOM! Chen's shotgun roars. The infected flies backward.
"They're still coming!" Chen shouts, chambering another round.
You turn to Dr. Yuen, forcing yourself to focus. You have proper medical supplies now. You need to clean and seal that laceration, stabilize her ribs, and get her mobile.
You grab the surgical laser (praying its battery holds), the remaining synth-flesh applicators, and get to work. Your four hands let you work efficiently - one pair cleaning the wound, the other preparing supplies.
"This is going to hurt," you warn Dr. Yuen.
"Do it," she gasps.
Roll another Medicine check (d20 + 1), but this time with advantage (roll twice, take the higher) because you have proper supplies and Chen is buying you time.
BOOM! Another shotgun blast. "Six shells left!" Chen calls out. "Whatever you're doing, do it fast! There's at least four more coming!"
The infected are moaning now, a low, harmonious sound that makes your skin crawl.
What do you roll? (Remember, roll 2d20 and take the higher result, then add 1)

player: I rolled 14 on a d20, +1 for 

claude: Medicine check: 15 (Success!)
Your hands work with the precision of someone who fixes delicate machinery. The surgical laser sputters but holds - you quickly cauterize the worst bleeding. The synth-flesh applicator seals the wound with a thick, protective layer. You wrap her ribs with the emergency bandages, tight enough to support but not restrict breathing.
Dr. Yuen gasps as the pain medications from the med kit kick in. Color returns to her face.
BOOM! "Five shells!" Chen shouts. An infected crashes into the doorframe, reaching for her with fingers that end in fungal blooms. She smashes it back with the butt of the shotgun.
"I can move," Dr. Yuen says, gripping your arm. "Not fast, but I can move."
You help her stand, supporting her weight. She's shaky but mobile.
"Chen, we're going!" you call out.
"About time!" Chen fires another round - BOOM! "Four shells! The path to the escape pods?"
Dr. Yuen points weakly. "Back exit. Through the recovery ward. It connects to Escape Bay 3."
But then she grabs your arm tighter. "Dax, before we go - the memory lock. You need to know. The cargo... Morrison was tricked. The seller knew what they were selling. This was intentional. Someone wanted these things loose on a ship."
The infected are pushing through faster than Chen can stop them. One gets past her guard, lurching toward you with arms outstretched, mouth opening to reveal fungal growths inside.
Six minutes of oxygen remaining.
What does Dax do?

player: dax shoots two rounds at the infected lunging for him, emptying it. he doesn't have time to reload - he's not even sure how. he regrets not having taken weapons specialization during his tech training. he never thought he'd need to, the meatheads always knew their guns better than him anyway.
he prepares the cryo-foam as the doctor's words linger. the urgency she's sharing this information at such a critical time... he has to know. he punches in the 

claude: BANG! BANG!
Your shots hit center mass. The infected stumbles backward, dark fluid leaking from the wounds, but it doesn't stop. It's still coming, just slower.
"They don't drop like normal!" Chen shouts, blasting another one. "Three shells!"
You holster your empty sidearm and grip the cryo-foam canister, but as you do, your other hand moves almost involuntarily to the keypad on your belt. Dr. Yuen's urgency, the desperation in her voice...
You punch in 5-5-3-7.
The effect is immediate and overwhelming.
MEMORY RESTORED:
You're in the cargo bay three weeks ago, scanner in hand. The "artifacts" are biological pods, clearly engineered. Your scan results show manufacturer tags - Weyland Biosystems, a black market weapons dealer.
You confront Morrison in private. He's shocked, horrified. "I thought they were archaeological samples! The seller said—"
"Captain, we need to jettison these NOW."
"We can't. Company paid too much. They'd court martial me."
You argue. Then you go to Dr. Yuen. Together you plan to disable them, make them 'accidentally' unusable. But you need to hide your knowledge first, in case something goes wrong. The memory lock was your insurance policy...
The flashback ends. You're back in the present. An infected is two meters away.
"DAX!" Chen screams.
You raise the cryo-foam canister and spray. The super-cooled foam engulfs the infected, flash-freezing the fungal growths. It stops mid-lunge, frozen solid.
"The cold!" Dr. Yuen gasps. "It kills the infection! The cryo-foam—"
But you only have one canister, already half-empty. More infected are coming.
Five minutes of oxygen left.
What does Dax do?

player: "we shoot it" dax says, "and run like hell"
dax throws the cryo-foam canister at the infected and shouts to chen, "BLAST IT!"
he uses his arms to help the doctor move quicker as he heads for the route to the escape pods, making sure chen is close with 

claude: You hurl the cryo-foam canister into the cluster of infected pushing through the doorway.
"BLAST IT!"
Chen doesn't need to be told twice. BOOM!
The canister explodes in a cloud of super-cooled foam and shrapnel. The infected caught in the blast freeze solid, their fungal growths crystallizing and shattering. The doorway is blocked by frozen bodies.
"Move! MOVE!"
You support Dr. Yuen with two arms while keeping your other two free for balance. Chen covers your retreat, walking backward with the shotgun ready. Two shells left.
You burst through the recovery ward - empty beds, dark monitors. The escape pod bay door is ahead, marked with green emergency lighting. You can hear the pods' ready signals beeping.
Behind you, crashing sounds. The frozen infected are being pushed aside by more of them.
You reach Escape Bay 3. Three pods are prepped and humming. Through the small windows, you can see stars.
"Get her in!" Chen shouts, helping you lift Dr. Yuen into the nearest pod.
As you strap the doctor in, she grabs your hand. "Dax... Weyland Biosystems. Remember that name. They did this deliberately. Someone needs to know."
Morrison's voice crackles over the intercom, weaker now: "All pods ready for launch. I'm... I'm initiating emergency separation in 60 seconds. Get in and seal up."
Chen is already climbing into the second pod. "Dax, come on!"
But you hear something. From the vents above. Clicking.
The Skitterers. They've found you.
What does Dax do?

player: ever the macguyver, dax takes the clip of 8 rounds for his sidearm and jury rigs the multitool to set them off 10 seconds before escape pod release. he climbs into a pod and seals it shut. "CAPTIAN", he shouts, "SEND US ALL TO <place>. AND... THANK YOU" (where <place> is whatever the nearest planet's largest friendly settlement is, that he'd know 

claude: You grab the spare ammunition clip and your multi-tool, working with desperate efficiency. The plasma torch function should generate enough heat to cook off the rounds when triggered. You wedge the clip against the bay door mechanism and set the sonic wrench to a delayed overload pulse - in 10 seconds it'll create enough vibration and heat to detonate the ammunition.
You dive into the third pod, slamming the hatch. Through the small window, you can see a Skitterer dropping from the vent just as your improvised bomb starts humming.
"CAPTAIN!" you shout into the pod's comm. "SEND US ALL TO TITAN STATION. AND... THANK YOU!"
Morrison's voice, barely a whisper now: "Titan Station. Confirmed. It's been... an honor, Stargazer. Tell them... tell them what happened here."
The multi-tool sparks. The ammunition detonates in a series of sharp cracks, sending the Skitterer reeling back.
"Emergency launch in 3... 2... 1..."
The pods fire with tremendous force, shooting you out into the void. Through your window, you watch the U.E.S. Wanderer shrink behind you. Small explosions ripple along its hull - the infected, the Skitterers, all contained within a dying ship.
In the pod's gentle emergency lighting, you can see Chen in pod 2, and Dr. Yuen in pod 1, both safely away. The vast black of space surrounds you, but for the first time in days, you feel genuinely safe.
The pod's nav computer chirps: "Course set: Titan Station. Arrival in 18 hours. Entering auto-sleep mode to preserve life support."
As the sedatives kick in, your last thought is clear: Weyland Biosystems. Someone will answer for this.
[END OF CHAPTER 1: THE WANDERER]

Would you like to continue with Dax's story on Titan Station, or shall we leave our hero here, safely drifting toward answers and, perhaps, revenge?

player: hell no, we carry on!
let's pause a sec though and update the artifact. we're gonna want a summary of things learned, things that happened. updated inventory - let's get a shared inventory going actually, for chen and yuen as well (although i don't think we know what yuen has on her yet). 
update the currency for something more apt, space-wise. also we seem to do a lot of medical, so let's get a medical quick action added (and maybe one more? something else we did a

The mystery of what Dr. Yuen has with her
The full story summary in the quest log


CHAPTER 2: TITAN STATION
18 hours later...
The escape pod's emergency lights flicker on as the sedatives wear off. Through the small porthole, you see it: Titan Station, a massive cylindrical structure rotating slowly against Saturn's pale gold backdrop. It's a trade hub, neutral territory, corporate and government interests all mixing in an uneasy dance.
Your pod shudders as docking clamps engage. A tinny automated voice crackles: "Welcome to Titan Station. Please remain seated for security scanning."
A red beam sweeps through the pod. "Bioscan complete. No contamination detected. Survivor of U.E.S. Wanderer, please proceed to Quarantine Bay 7 for processing."
The hatch hisses open. You stumble out onto a stark white docking platform. Chen is already there, helping Dr. Yuen who looks pale but stable. Around you, a dozen security officers in full environmental suits point rifles your way.
"Easy," says a voice through an external speaker. "Standard quarantine protocol. We picked up your distress beacon. The Wanderer is listed as... lost with all hands?"
Before you can answer, Dr. Yuen speaks up: "Three survivors. The ship suffered catastrophic breach. We need to speak to Station Administrator immediately. This was not an accident."
What does Dax do?

player: wait one sec, pause until i say restart, just wanna work some things out
1. good ask at the end of ch1 - i don't really see this 'ending' unless dax fails so hard he kicks the bucket. it is a solo campaign so once he's dead, it's over. i think? i dunno, maybe let's leave it open to perhaps jumping into another character's shoes (e.g. if dax had stayed back on the ship in ch1, i take over chen instead for ch2).
2. along those lines, i don't mind long periods without 'action'. we had a very explosive start, which was awesome, but i also like diplomacy and politics and that kind of on-world drama too. i'm a big fan of like mass effect and the expanse novels and such (please don't start including biotics and beltalowda now lol). let's go full space opera.
3. technical question - i just realized this conversation's gonna hit a max limit, isn't it? can you bake something into the save function that's like a CLAUDE.md note to yourself for continuing it on in a new conversation? i think you can look back at previous ones, right? so you could see this one (and the artifact?) and recreate + carry 

claude: Perfect pause points! Let me address each:
1. Death & Character Switching: Absolutely! If Dax dies, we could definitely continue with Chen or Dr. Yuen's perspective. Or even introduce a new character investigating what happened. The story continues even if Dax doesn't. Makes the stakes real without ending everything.
2. Space Opera Vibes: Love it! Politics, corporate espionage, station intrigue, investigation, tense negotiations - all fantastic. We can have long stretches of detective work, relationship building, and political maneuvering. Think more DS9 than just Alien. The Weyland conspiracy is perfect for this.
3. Continuation System: Smart thinking! Let me add a save note function:D&D Solo Campaign CompanionInteractive artifact ∙ Version 31 Perfect! I've added a "Campaign Notes" section that includes:

A template for continuation notes
Current story state
Key plot points
GM style preferences

When you save the game, this will all be included. If we hit the conversation limit, you can paste this into a new conversation and I'll have everything I need to continue seamlessly. I can also search back to this conversation to see the full artifact and history.
The save function now captures both the mechanical game state AND the narrative context, so we could pick up exactly where we left off.
Ready to restart whenever you are! Dax is standing on that platform with rifles pointed at him, about to navigate the political minefield of Titan Station...

claude: Got it - multi-tool is gone, sacrificed for that explosive exit!

CHAPTER 2: TITAN STATION
The security officers keep their weapons trained on you. The lead officer's voice crackles through their suit speaker again, more insistent: "Three survivors? Our scans showed... that's impossible. The Wanderer's emergency beacon indicated total atmospheric breach over 72 hours ago."
Dr. Yuen sways slightly, and Chen steadies her. "We need medical attention, not an interrogation," Chen snaps. "The doctor's injured."
The lead officer hesitates, then gestures to their team. "Lower weapons. But maintain quarantine protocol." They turn back to you. "I'm Lieutenant Commander Reeves, Titan Security. You'll be escorted to Quarantine Medical for full decontamination and debriefing. Any weapons must be surrendered now."
Chen reluctantly hands over the shotgun with its two remaining shells. You have nothing left to give - your sidearm is empty, just dead weight.
As you're escorted through stark white corridors, you notice Titan Station is nothing like the Wanderer. Every surface is pristine, corporate logos everywhere - Sakura Industries, Kepler Mining Consortium, and there, making your blood run cold - a small Weyland Biosystems office marker.
Dr. Yuen notices your reaction and grabs your arm, whispering: "Not here. Not yet."
The quarantine medical bay is a hive of activity. You're separated - different examination rooms. A medtech in a hazmat suit runs scanner after scanner over you. "Remarkable," they mutter. "No contamination, but these stress markers... what happened out there?"
Through the observation window, you can see Chen in another room, arguing with her examiner. Dr. Yuen is on a medical bed, proper doctors treating her injuries.
The door hisses open. A woman enters - mid-40s, sharp suit, no hazmat gear. Corporate authority radiates from her.
"Mr. Stargazer. I'm Director Sarah Holbrook, Titan Station Administration. I understand you have quite a story to tell. And accusations to make about one of our corporate tenants?" She sits across from you, placing a tablet on the table. "Please. Start from the beginning."
What does Dax do?

player: dax ignores the director and asks a nearby doctor about chen and yuen's 

claude: You turn away from Director Holbrook entirely, focusing on the medtech still in the room running scans.
"My crew," you say firmly. "Chen and Dr. Yuen. What's their status?"
The medtech glances nervously at the Director, who raises an eyebrow but nods permission.
"The engineer - Chen - is uninjured. Elevated stress hormones, mild dehydration, but physically fine. She's... uh... being quite vocal about wanting to rejoin you." Through the window, you can see Chen gesturing emphatically at her examiner.
"Dr. Yuen is stable," the medtech continues. "Three cracked ribs, deep tissue laceration, significant blood loss - but she'll recover. We're treating her with regenerative gel. She'll need at least 48 hours of observation."
Director Holbrook clears her throat. "Your concern for your crew is admirable, Mr. Stargazer. But we have protocols. Three survivors from a ship that should have been completely vented to space? Biological hazard warnings in your emergency beacon? And now accusations against Weyland Biosystems?"
She leans forward. "I need answers. The station's safety depends on it. Twenty thousand souls live here. So I'll ask again - what happened on the Wanderer?"
The director's tablet sits between you, recording everything. In the corner of your vision, you notice the small Weyland Biosystems logo on one of the medical supply cabinets.
What does Dax do?

player: dax explains what happened. he gives incredible detail about the creatures, how they were fought off in various situations. same with the infected, and the giant one that seemed to be made of people. he describes the cargo hold, their escape. the bravery of their captain.
at no point, though, does he mention weyland through this. very 

claude: You speak for nearly twenty minutes, your voice steady and clinical. You describe the Skitterers - their blindness, their sensitivity to sound, the clicking of their chitin on metal. You detail their vulnerability to heat and how their webs burn but turn brittle when frozen.
Director Holbrook's expression shifts from skepticism to concern as you describe the infected crew members, the fungal growths, their immunity to conventional weapons. Her stylus stops moving when you describe the amalgamation - the thing that had absorbed people and materials into itself, growing, spreading.
"We improvised weapons from dead datapads," you explain, your four hands demonstrating the precise angle needed to puncture the batteries. "The thermal discharge was our only effective defense against the Skitterers."
You describe Morrison's final stand, maintaining quarantine protocols even as he bled out in the captain's chair. The medtech has stopped pretending to work, listening with rapt horror.
"The cargo bay," you continue, "was covered in organic residue. Pulsing growths on the walls. We believe that's where the contamination originated - some kind of artifact or sample that breached containment."
Holbrook's eyes narrow slightly. "Artifacts? What kind of artifacts?"
You shrug with all four shoulders. "Unknown. The captain's logs might have that information, but they went down with the ship. Whatever it was, it wasn't properly catalogued or secured."
The Director exchanges a glance with someone behind the one-way observation glass. "Mr. Stargazer, you're saying this was a containment breach? An accident?"
"I'm saying twenty-three people are dead," you reply evenly. "And three of us barely escaped. The cause is for investigators to determine."
She studies you carefully. "Indeed. You'll be interested to know that Weyland Biosystems has already filed an insurance claim for lost cargo aboard the Wanderer. They're citing improper handling by the crew as the cause."
Your mandibles twitch - a Vexian tell that humans rarely recognize. But you keep your voice neutral. "Is that so?"
What does Dax do?

player: mmm let's roll something for dax to stay 

claude: You feel your mandibles starting to twitch more visibly - a dead giveaway of your agitation to anyone who knows Vexian body language. Weyland is already spinning the narrative, blaming the dead crew for their own murders.
Roll a Wisdom saving throw (d20 + your Wisdom modifier of +1) to maintain your composure and not reveal that you know more than you're saying.
This is crucial - if you lose control now, you might tip your hand too early. The Director is watching you carefully, and whoever is behind that observation glass is certainly recording everything.
What do you roll?

player: whew, I rolled 17 on a d20 +1 for 

claude: Wisdom saving throw: 18 (Success!)
You take a slow breath through your spiracles, a 

claude: ative technique from your homeworld. Your mandibles still, your four hands rest calmly on the table. When you speak, your voice is perfectly level.
"Insurance claims already? The crew isn't even cold yet." You let just the right amount of disgust creep in - what any survivor would feel. "I suppose corporate efficiency doesn't pause for grief."
Director Holbrook watches you intently. "You were the ship's Tech-Scout, correct? You'd have access to cargo manifests, shipping records..."
"I had access to a lot of systems," you reply carefully. "My job was maintaining equipment, not questioning cargo. Captain Morrison handled acquisitions."
"And Morrison is conveniently dead."
The temperature in the room seems to drop. Chen's voice carries through the wall - she's shouting now, though you can't make out words.
"Captain Morrison died a hero," you say, letting real emotion color your voice. "He stayed at his post to maintain quarantine. He saved this station from infection. Convenience had nothing to do with it."
Holbrook taps her stylus against the tablet. "Mr. Stargazer, I'm going to be frank. Weyland Biosystems has significant interests on this station. They employ 300 people here. They're demanding we declare this an act of crew negligence so they can collect their insurance. But your story..." she pauses, "suggests something else."
She leans back. "What I need is proof. Documentation. Recordings. Something more than the testimony of traumatized survivors."
Behind her, the door opens. A young man in a Weyland Biosystems uniform enters, datapad in hand. "Director, Mr. Kellerman wants to know if the survivors are ready for corporate debriefing."
Your mandibles definitely twitch at that.
What does Dax do?

player: (who is dax and co.'s employer? like the owner of the ship/the captain's 

claude: (Good question! Let me establish this - it's important for the political dynamics)
The U.E.S. Wanderer was operated by United 

claude: ions Syndicate - a mid-tier shipping and exploration company that handles cargo runs and survey missions in the outer systems. Not a huge corporation, but respectable. They have a small office here on Titan Station, probably just two or three people.
Captain Morrison reported to U.E.S. management, who would have contracted with Weyland for the "artifact" transport. U.E.S. would be liable if crew negligence is proven - their insurance would have to pay out Weyland's claim.

Director Holbrook notices your reaction to the Weyland representative. "Mr. Kellerman can wait," she says coolly. "These survivors are still in medical quarantine."
The young Weyland employee shifts uncomfortably. "Sir, Mr. Kellerman insisted—"
"And I'm insisting he wait." Her tone could freeze helium. "Out."
He retreats. Holbrook turns back to you.
"United 

claude: ions Syndicate has already been notified of the loss. They're sending a representative, but it'll be three days before they arrive. In the meantime, Weyland is pushing hard for immediate depositions. They want this wrapped up quickly."
She stands. "You and your crewmates will be kept in protective custody - for your safety and continued medical observation, of course. You'll have quarters in Section C. Comfortable, but monitored."
The way she says 'protective' makes it clear - you're not prisoners, but you're not exactly free either.
"One more thing, Mr. Stargazer. That memory gap you mentioned in your initial medical scan - the one from three weeks before the incident - Weyland's legal team will definitely use that against your testimony."
She heads for the door, then pauses. "If there were proof of what really happened... now would be the time to remember where it might be."
What does Dax do?

player: dax is torn. he's not the most perceptive, but he's smart enough to see that however much influence weyland might have galactically/universally (whatever their reach is), it's clear who the boss is on titan. maybe those 300 employees don't count for much in the grand scheme of things? maybe the director's not actually a fan of weyland either... he regrets acting quite so cold towards her; though she's clearly no friend, she's in between them and weyland right now, which is certainly not a foe. he needs to know more about her, her office, her peers, before he can trust.it's still too early to tip his hand. and what evidence? dax's medical scanner has logs on the creatures, but won't help accusations of crew malpractice. martinez's data log though... dax hopes chen's keeping it tight to her chest. dax thanks the director for their protection and their medical aid, and asks if they could arrange for him to speak with titan's UES 

claude: Director Holbrook pauses at the door, considering your request. "The U.E.S. representative on-station is... not what you'd expect from a company that just lost a ship and crew. But yes, I can arrange that."
She turns back, studying you with calculating eyes. "Jonathan Park. He runs the U.E.S. office here - though 'office' is generous. It's mostly a mail drop and comms relay. He'll be notified you're alive within the hour."
The medtech clears their throat. "Director, the quarantine period?"
"48 hours minimum," Holbrook confirms. "Mr. Stargazer, you'll have comm access from your quarters, but all communications will be monitored - standard quarantine protocol, you understand. Can't risk contamination spreading through the station's networks."
She means Weyland will be listening too, you realize.
"Your personal effects will be returned after decontamination," she continues. "Though I understand there isn't much. A dead scanner, an empty weapon. Nothing else?"
It's a probe, careful but clear. She's asking if you have evidence hidden somewhere.
Through the observation window, you see Chen being escorted out, flanked by two security officers. She catches your eye through the glass and taps her chest pocket twice - a subtle gesture, but clear. Martinez's data log is still with her, still hidden.
"Just what you see," you answer Holbrook. "We left with what we could carry."
"Indeed." She keys something into her tablet. "Mr. Park will contact you once you're settled. Fair warning - he's been on-station for three years without a single incident. This situation is... beyond his usual scope."
Translation: he's a bureaucrat, not equipped for corporate warfare against Weyland.
The door hisses open again. "Medical will finish your examination. Welcome to Titan Station, Mr. Stargazer. Try not to cause the kind of trouble that follows survival stories."
What does Dax do?

player: (by the way, when i ask a clarifying question ooc like this, please don't move the story along. i'm just looking for a clarification so i can make a good decision. with that said, where is dax and co. headed right now? a quarrantine holding was 

claude: (Got it - I'll keep things frozen until you decide what to do. Here's the clarification:)
Current situation:

You're still in the medical examination room with the medtech
Director Holbrook just left
Chen has been escorted out by security (you saw her through the window)
Dr. Yuen is still being treated in another room

Where you're headed:

After medical finishes examining you, you'll be taken to "quarters in Section C"
These are quarantine quarters - comfortable but monitored rooms where you'll spend the mandatory 48-hour observation period
You'll have comm access but all communications will be monitored
It's "protective custody" - not quite prison, but you can't leave freely

The three of you will likely have separate quarters but in the same section. Think of it like a medical isolation ward crossed with a decent hotel - private rooms, basic amenities, but locked doors and cameras everywhere.

player: as dax leaves and is escorted to the section C quarters, he examines his surroundings extremely carefully and intently to gauge exactly how much influence weyland has on this 

claude: (Understood - no story progression on OOC questions. Let me describe what Dax observes:)
The medtech finishes their scans and two security officers arrive to escort you. As you walk through Titan Station's corridors, your trained eye catalogues everything:
Corporate Presence Visible:

Wall displays cycle through advertisements - about 1 in 5 are Weyland Biosystems (biomedical supplies, "frontier development solutions," mining equipment)
Directory signs list companies: Sakura Industries seems biggest (they have a whole section), Kepler Mining Consortium is prominent, Weyland has a modest office suite on Level 7
Security uniforms have Titan Station patches, not corporate logos - station security, not private
Maintenance crews wear station colors too

Power Dynamics You Notice:

The security officers escort you past a Weyland office branch; the corporate workers barely glance up - they don't seem to have special authority
A Sakura Industries exec argues with station security at a checkpoint and loses, having to submit to scanning
Port workers loading cargo wear different company logos but all answer to station dock authorities
Emergency protocols posted everywhere are signed by "Titan Station Authority" not any corporation

The Layout:

Section C (quarantine) is in the station's inner ring - prime real estate, suggesting the station takes quarantine seriously
Weyland's offices are mid-ring, not the prestigious outer ring with views of Saturn
The Administrator's offices you passed earlier were central, upper level - the seat of real power

Your Assessment:
Weyland has money and influence here, but they're one of several corporate players, not the boss. The station itself maintains independence. Director Holbrook runs things, and she doesn't seem to be in anyone's pocket - yet.
The quarters door looms ahead.
What does Dax do?

player: (prolly should have been a wisdom roll lol but i appreciate it)dax is relieved to see that titan station is not one that has been overridden with corporate influence - *yet. *he notes the location of the weyland offices as he passes, sure that he'll be returning there in one capacity or another before this is over.
he continues on his escort to 

claude: (Yeah, a Wisdom/Perception roll would've been appropriate there - good catch!)
The security officers lead you into Section C. The corridor here is different from the industrial grey of the docking area - warmer lighting, actual color on the walls (a calming blue-green), even some plants in wall-mounted containers. It's designed to be less threatening, but the cameras in every corner and the mag-locked doors remind you what this really is.
"Room C-7," one officer says, keying open a door. "Your personal effects will be delivered after decontamination. Food service is automated - use the panel. Comms are on the desk. Any medical emergency, hit the red button."
The room is... nice, actually. A bed sized for various species (it'll accommodate your Vexian frame), a small workspace with a communications terminal, a viewport showing Saturn's rings in the distance. There's even a beverage dispenser - coffee, tea, various other options.
"Your crewmates are in C-5 and C-9," the officer adds. "No physical contact during quarantine, but you can use internal comms. Quarantine lifts in 48 hours assuming no contamination signs."
They leave, and the door seals with a soft hiss. You're alone for the first time in days.
The comms terminal is already blinking with a message indicator. The screen shows:

1 Message from J.PARK (United 

claude: ions Syndicate)
System Notice: All communications monitored per Quarantine Protocol 7

What does Dax do?

player: (ooc pause: can you gimme some world lore? it seems we're in the milky way, very advanced, with alien settlers. just as much as dax would know as a regular citizen(?), though also as one of such settlers. but he's no history buff or 

claude: (OOC World Lore - what Dax knows as a regular spacer:)
